First Look of Do-It-Yourself Animated Video Making App\nInfographic: 12 Amazing Facts on the Effects of Animation on Kids Brain\nTake a Selfie and Nail It Like a Pro! - Perfect Selfies Made Easy\nPage 7/10: How to Make a Whiteboard Video - A Guide for Engaging Content! - Video Making and Marketing Blog\nHow to Make a Whiteboard Video - A Guide for Engaging Content!\nPicture this - you’re gearing up to present your latest idea, and you’re just hoping everyone stays awake and doesn’t doze off.\nBut what if, instead of another forgettable slideshow or static visual, you had a whiteboard video that made people sit up, pay attention, and actually get excited about what you’re sharing?\nIt’s like upgrading from lukewarm coffee to double-shot espresso - suddenly, everyone’s wide awake and following along!\nWhiteboard videos are the secret sauce for turning complicated ideas into visual stories that stick.\nImagine transforming dry facts into engaging illustrations or complex processes into straightforward animations that everyone can grasp.\nWith the magic of a whiteboard video, even the most intricate topics become exciting narratives people engage in.\nWhether you’re a content creator building your next viral video, a product marketer explaining your latest offering, or a trainer looking to make learning more fun, a whiteboard video can make your message both clear and captivating.\nAnd here’s the best part - creating a whiteboard video doesn’t have to be complicated or expensive.\nWhat if I told you that you could create professional-looking videos without needing any prior experience or breaking the bank?\nThat’s possible with Animaker’s WhiteBoard Video Maker , an all-in-one animation video creation tool that makes video production a breeze.\nIts drag-and-drop interface makes it easy for anyone to create professional-looking videos.\nThe platform comes loaded with everything you need, from a vast library of pre-made assets, animations, and soundtracks to features for adding AI voiceovers and creating custom characters.\nWhether you're an educator wanting to make learning more engaging, a business owner explaining a product or service, or a content creator looking to add some flair to your storytelling, Animaker has you covered.\nLet’s dive into how to make a whiteboard video with Animaker that’ll leave a lasting impression.\nHow to make a whiteboard video with Animaker?\nLet’s get started by logging in or signing up to Animaker .\nHere, in the dashboard, click on “Create”\nThen click on “Create a video” > “Blank Page”.\nThis will open a pop-up box with the two types of animation styles and the different aspect ratio sizes.\nClick the whiteboard style and select the aspect ratio, which will open a blank project. Let me give you a quick tour of the project window.\nThe workspace sits at the center of your screen for creating and editing your video with ease. To the left, you’ll find the extensive library with millions of assets, everything you need to bring your video to life. On the right, you’ll see the scenes section, where you can smoothly organize, arrange, and manage your scenes for a seamless flow.\nJust above the workspace, there’s a menu bar that offers additional tools and options to refine your video. At the bottom, the timeline allows you to make precise adjustments to your video, ensuring that every asset is perfectly timed.\nNow that you know the interface better, let’s see how to make a whiteboard video with Animaker.\nI’m going to make a whiteboard video on Essential Sales Techniques and Negotiation Tips to Win Every Deal.\nWe can use Animaker's library of 150M+ assets to enhance our whiteboard video by adding the following elements -\nWithout any further ado, let's begin with the background.\nTo begin, let's add a background to the scene. Click on the \"Bg\" option in the library.\nHere, you will find 20 different whiteboard backgrounds from corporate settings to casual indoors.\nYou can either choose one from these options or generate a background using AI.\nI, however, am going to select one from the library and add it to the scene.\nYou can also change the colors of the elements in the background by clicking on the “Change Color” box above the workspace and clicking on the individual colors to change them.\nThat’s how we add backgrounds to our video! As easy as that!\nLet’s move on to the next element.\nAnimaker’s whiteboard character library has nearly 20 characters with different ethnicities and clothing styles.\nTo add a character, simply click on the “Character” option in the library and choose your preferred character.\nYou can select from the available options or create a custom whiteboard character from scratch, allowing you full control to design a character that closely resembles anyone in your organization.\nHow exciting is that?! Now, to do that, click on the “Create a New Character” button.\nThis will open the character builder tool.\nHere, choose the whiteboard style and select the gender. Then, select a base character to start with.\nNow, start customizing every feature, from skin tones and hairstyles to outfits and accessories.\nOnce you finish customizing, click “Save” and then select the “Back to Project” button to go back to making the whiteboard video.\nThe custom character you create gets saved in the “My Characters” section above the prebuilt characters in the Character library.\nClick on the character to add it to the video. When a character is added, you will notice a normal and a highlighted pink section appear in the scene timeline below.\nThe normal pink section denotes the duration of the character's appearance in the scene.\nYou can control this by adjusting the ends of the pink section across the timeline. Since I want my character to appear throughout the scene, I’ll keep the pink section throughout the scene timeline.\nThat’s how you adjust the character’s appearance.\nThe highlighted pink section, on the other hand, is the hand-drawing animation duration of the element. Adjust it to control how quickly you want the hand-drawing animation.\nThis way, you can control how long the hand-drawing animation takes. Take a look at it below -\nNow that we have adjusted the duration, the whiteboard character is simply standing. Let’s add some action to it.\nClick on the character on the left, there is a panel with many animated actions and expressions. Scroll through the actions or search for them in the search bar.\nHere, I’ve selected an explaining action paired with a smiling expression for my character. See how easy it is to add a character and actions to it?\nNext, let’s see how to add voice to this character.\nTo add voice to the character, click on the character and select the Lip-sync option. This opens a panel on the side with three options.\n• Record Voice - Record your voice directly.\n• Text To Speech - Add AI-generated voiceovers to the character.\n• Upload - Upload an existing audio file and sync it with the character.\nHere, I’m going to make use of the “Text to Speech” feature to add AI voices to the whiteboard character.\nAnimaker offers over 2,000 AI voices in 200+ languages, allowing you to add high-quality, realistic voiceovers in seconds.\nTo use this feature, click on the option, and you will see a pop-up window where you can type in the lines from your content.\nOnce you type in the script, you can select options like category, language, gender, and voice to generate an AI voice.\nClick “Play” to preview the AI voice and “Add to Timeline” to add the voice to the character.\nOnce you add the voice to the timeline, you can adjust its position by dragging it to the desired spot. Here, I’m moving the voice to the end of the highlighted section, which marks the end of the drawing animation.\nThis ensures that the voice starts playing only after the drawing animation is complete.\nThis is how we easily add an AI voice to the character. Click play to see how it turned out!\nSee how the character automatically lip-syncs to the voice, giving it a natural look? Looks great, right?\nNow, let’s see how to add properties to this scene to make it even better!\nProperties are objects, shapes, and illustrations that enhance the scene by adding extra detail and visual interest.\nAnimaker has 1000s of properties ranging from office supplies to animated icons, which you can add to make your whiteboard video more detailed.\nTo add a property, click on the Property option in the library. Search for a particular property in the search box or scroll through until you find one.\nI’m going to search for a desk to add to the scene. Once you’ve selected a property, you can easily resize and position it as needed.\nJust like when a character is added, a colored section with a highlighted section appears in the timeline when the property is added.\nYou guessed it right—the colored section represents the duration of the property in the scene, while the highlighted section shows the duration of the hand-drawing animation.\nAdjust these sections on the timeline as needed. For example, you can time the property’s hand-drawing animation to finish first, followed by the character’s hand-drawing animation.\nThis way, when the scene begins, the property is drawn first, then the character, and finally, the voiceover starts.\nThis is how you add a property to a scene. Let’s move on to the next element!\nIn this introduction scene, there is a bare whiteboard in the background! Let’s add text to it.\nTo do that, click on the “Text” option from the library.\nThis will open two types of text boxes – Pre-builds and Plain.\nPlain text boxes require designing from scratch, while Pre-builds have pre-added design, font, and animation effects.\nChoose a type and position it in the scene. Then, type in the title of your content. I’m choosing a plain text box.\nOn the side, when you click on the text box, you'll find the Edit Text panel, which offers a variety of editing options. Here, you can customize the text by changing the font, size, and other attributes to suit your design needs.\nYou can also change the color of the text by clicking on the “Change Color” option above the workspace.\nJust like with the previous elements, you can also adjust the duration of this text box. In the scene timeline, the orange section indicates the duration of the text in the scene.\nYou can modify the ends of this section to control when the text appears during the scene.\nWe have the highlighted section denoting the hand-drawing animation here as well. Adjust this section to control the duration of that animation.\nBut hey, what if you want some other animation instead of this same hand-drawing animation?!\nWe have options for that as well! Click on the text box and then click on the hand icon in the highlighted section in the timeline.\nThis will open the animation panel on the left with 35+ enter and exit animation effects to choose from and add to your text.\nYou can choose no effect or one of those many available options for both enter and exit.\nIf you select some other effects, you will notice two highlighted sections appear on either end of the orange section on the timeline. These sections indicate the duration of the effects.\nAdjust the duration by simply dragging the inner corners of the highlighted sections.\nThis is how you add animated text to a scene!\nSo far, we have added a background, character, voice, property, and text to the introduction scene. This way, you can add multiple scenes to make a complete video.\nTo add a new scene, click on the three dots on the scene tab on the right. It will open two options: Add Scene and Duplicate.\nChoose Add Scene if you want to create a new scene from scratch, or choose Duplicate if you want a new scene with all the previous elements in it.\nNote that every scene’s duration is 10 seconds by default. You can always adjust the scene’s duration by clicking on the “+” and the “-” signs in the bottom right corner to increase or decrease the duration.\nThis way, you can add multiple scenes to your whiteboard video!\nOnce you’re done making all the scenes, it is time to add one final element to the video, if needed.\nMusic has the power to elevate your videos, setting the mood and enhancing the overall experience. It’s crucial to select music that aligns perfectly with the video’s theme and vibe.\nTo add music to your video, simply click on the “Music” option in the library, then select “Expand Library”.\nThis gives you access to over 30,000 tracks to explore. You can preview any track by hovering over it, and once you find the right one, just click to add it to your project.\nIf you have your own music track that you'd like to use, click on the “Upload” option in the library. Click on the uploaded track from the “Uploads” folder and the music gets added to the scene.\nNote: The music will start playing from the position of the playhead on the timeline. To ensure the music begins at the start of your video, place the play head at the beginning before adding the track.\nAnd that’s how easy it is to add music to your video!\nIf you want to adjust the volume of the music, right-click on the three dots in the music section on the timeline. Then, slide the volume bar to your liking.\nWith all the scenes created, use the preview button to view the video from the beginning.\nIf you are satisfied with your video, then click on “Publish” > “Download Video”.\nHere, choose the resolution and format of the video, and then click “Download”.\nThe video will begin to render, and you can download it from the “Exports” page.\nThis is how easy it is to make a whiteboard video using Animaker!\nCreating a whiteboard video with Animaker is not only easy but also an incredibly effective way to share your message in a fun and engaging manner.\nBy following the steps outlined in this guide, you can produce professional-quality whiteboard videos that not only capture attention but also clearly communicate your ideas.\nSo, whether you're an educator, a business professional, or a content creator, dive into Animaker’s Whiteboard Video Maker , explore your creativity, and watch your concepts spring to life on a virtual whiteboard!\nGet ready to transform your messages into dynamic visual stories that resonate with your audience and make a lasting impact!\nA Beginner’s Guide to Animated Video Making for business\nA Beginner’s Guide to Script Writing for Animated videos\n20 Tips for Creating Video That Gets Watched, Shared and Talked\nPage 8/10: Video Making and Marketing Blog\nRaghav - February 4, 2022 - Leave your thoughts.\nAnimaker 2.0 , animated videos , video making , What's New?\nIt’s a new year again and that means it’s time for a new article that covers 2 key topics!

    "plain_text": "Page 1/1: The 50 Best Cartoon Characters of All Time\nThe 50 Best Cartoon Characters of All Time\nCartoons have changed a lot in the decade since Paste originally published this list. Sure, new episodes of The Simpsons , Family Guy , South Park and SpongeBob Squarepants are churned out each year like clockwork, but they’re only the tip of the iceberg. Traditional cable networks have created new and exciting characters and worlds in animation, while streaming platforms have allowed even more creators to make the animated shows they want to make.\nNo longer are cartoons something only for children to enjoy on Saturday mornings. Many employ wittier humor, more complex characters and deeper stories to engage those of any age, while even more target teens or adults as their prime audience, giving them the ability to tell relatable, powerful and hilarious stories within the realm of animation. Western cartoons have never been as varied as they are now, and I believe they have the potential to reach the same cultural status anime took decades ago in Japan.\nWith the world of cartoons changing so dramatically, we decided it was time to update our list of the top 50 cartoon characters of all time, taking into account the cultural influence, relatability, and relevance these animated humans, animals, vegetables, etc. hold within the realm of animation in the 2020s. Many of these characters have expanded beyond their cartoon origins into other media, but for the purposes of this list, we will only be examining these characters as they appear in cartoons, originating either from the show itself or corresponding comics and books. — Joseph Stanichar\n50. Bender ( Futurama ) Created: 1999 Creator: Matt Groening Voice: John DiMaggio\nMade in Mexico, Bender is a sociopath of steel (er, well, iron, titanium, lead, zinc, dolomite and nickel), who has kidnapped Jay Leno’s head and sent his own son to robot hell. But he really just wants to be a folk-singer. — Josh Jackson\n49. Beavis & Butt-Head Created: 1992 Creator: Mike Judge Voices: Mike Judge\nBeavis and Butt-Head made MTV’s lack of music much more palatable. The show managed to both satirize and celebrate the lowest common denominator of the 1990s. Since then, we’ve had another season in 2011 and two more on their way during the ‘20s, ensuring these two doofuses’ influence throughout four decades. — Josh Jackson\n48. Larry the Cucumber ( Veggie Tales ) Created: 1993 Creators: Phil Vischer, Mike Nawrocki Voice: Mike Nawrocki\nAfter all the cultural good that Christianity gave us over the last two Millennia, the second half of the 20th century wasn’t exactly a high-water mark. But in the 1990s, Veggie Tales became the exceptional piece of genius pop culture in the typical Christian bookstore. And Larry the Cucumber was the biggest reason why, with his “Silly Songs with Larry” segments being the most popular among both kids of the ‘90s and today in the show’s current iteration, The VeggieTales Show . — Josh Jackson\n47. Angelica Pickles ( Rugrats ) Created: 1991 Creator: Arlene Klasky Voice: Cheryl Chase\nThe ultimate spoiled brat alpha child, Angelica Pickles ran the baby Rugrats like her own syndicate. An off-key antagonist who never saw something she couldn’t be jealous of or use for her own motivations, Angelica’s greatest legacy is making viewers realize she doesn’t represent their “terrible” sibling, but more honestly themselves. — Allison Keene\n46. Space Ghost ( Coast to Coast ) Created: 1966 Creators: Alex Toth, William Hanna, Joseph Barbera / Mike Lazzo Voices: George Lowe, C. Martin Croker, Andy Merrill, Don Kennedy\nOn his own, most probably wouldn’t remember brief Hanna Barbera creation Space Ghost. But thanks to Mike Lazzo, the character was repurposed in the 1990s as the awkward, hostile host of a surrealist talk show that ended up launching careers and inspiring a number of other great series (like Sealab 2021 and Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law ) that similarly repurposed old Warner IP for our modern amusement. — Allison Keene\n45. Johnny Bravo Created: 1995 Creators: Van Partible Voice: Jeff Bennett\nIt’s unlikely that a show like Johnny Bravo would be made today. Created right before the realm of adult cartoons really took off, this show was still marketed for kids but let lots of risque humor through under Cartoon Network’s radar. Even though Johnny’s behavior borders on the chauvinistic, the show makes clear that he’s meant to be the opposite of a role model, nearly always suffering some awful fate due to his hubris. Still, his nonsensical pick-up lines are ironically delightful. My favorite one: “Hey pretty mama, wanna see me comb my hair really fast?” — Joseph Stanichar\n44. Felix the Cat Created: 1919 Creators: Pat Sullivan, Otto Messmer Voices: Jack Mercer, various others\nMost stars of the silent era didn’t survive the transition to sound, but Felix—who once shared screen-time with Charlie Chaplin—did just fine and remains an icon. — Josh Jackson\n43. Cosmo and Wanda ( The Fairly Oddparents ) Created: 1997 Creator: Butch Hartman Voices: Daran Norris, Susanne Blakeslee\nThe wacky, impulsive Cosmo and the calm, pragmatic Wanda may seem like a (fairly) odd couple, but given that they’ve been together for 10,000 years, they’re obviously doing something right. The fairy godparents of 10-year-old Timmy Turner, Cosmo and Wanda have the power to grant his every wish, which always inevitably goes wrong. It’s this premise that gave The Fairly Oddparents its fun, lighthearted style in each of its 172 episodes. — Joseph Stanichar\n42. Arthur Created: 1976 Creator: Marc Brown Voices: Michael Yarmush, Roman Lutterotti, various others\nBased on Marc Brown’s children’s books, the Arthur TV series has been on the air since 1996. In that time, the aardvark—along with his friends and family—has learned hundreds of lessons about how to “get along with each other,” as the groovy theme song indicates. Arthur and his friends feel like real kids, acting and speaking in ways that actual kids their age do, getting into arguments and misbehaving in ways that other shows might try to censor. The PBS show has also been consistently inclusive with representations of characters with different cultures, identities, disabilities and even diseases such as cancer, in a way that’s respectful while not talking down to kids. — Joseph Stanichar\n41. Yogi Bear Created: 1958 Creators: William Hanna, Joseph Barbera, Ed Benedict Voices: Daws Butler, Greg Burson, various others\nHe’s smarter than the average bear, but it’s not just cleverness that makes Yogi great. It’s his joyful love of harmless mischief that made every episode a classic. — Josh Jackson\n40. Daffy Duck ( Looney Tunes ) Created: 1937 Creators: Tex Avery, Bob Clampett Voices: Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman, various others\nYes, Daffy can himself be “despicable!” but as his enduring popularity shows, he’s endearing all the same. — Josh Jackson\n39. Daria Morgendorffer Created: 1993 Creators: Mike Judge, Glenn Eichler Voice: Tracy Grandstaff\nDaria Morgendorffer weathered suburbia under an armor of sublime snark that was essential for any alt girl in the 90s to study. Affecting and entertaining with absurd sidestories and clever social commentary, Daria was so fun to watch. — Julia Askense\n38. Ed, Edd & Eddy Created: 1999 Creator: Danny Antonucci Voices: Matt Hill, Samuel Vincent, Tony Sampson\nA cartoonish incarnation of the three stooges, these characters brought simple, stupid slapstick back onto TV, and we couldn’t be more grateful. — Joseph Stanichar\n37. Grunkle Stan ( Gravity Falls ) Created: 2012 Creator: Alex Hirsch Voice: Alex Hirsch\nA perfect combination of comedy and mystery, Dipper and Mabel Pines’ great-uncle, aka. “Grunkle” Stanford Pines is a swindler, running a tourist trap named the Mystery Shack and seemingly only interested in robbing people of their money through cheaply made and fraudulently advertised products and attractions. However, as the series progresses, we discover another, more secretive side to the grunkle, with fans discovering an ominous cryptogram in Gravity Falls ’ opening theme: “Stan is not what he seems.” — Joseph Stanichar\n36. Stewie Griffin ( Family Guy ) Created: 1999 Creator: Seth MacFarlane Voice: Seth MacFarlane\nOther evil geniuses aren’t hampered by their youth, but one-year-old baby Stewie doesn’t let that stop him. Despite, you know, being a year old for over 20 years. — Josh Jackson\n35. Popeye Created: 1929 Creator: E. C. Segar Voices: William Costello (1933-1935), Jack Mercer (1935-1984), various others\nAmong the earliest icons of American animation, Popeye the Sailor became instantly beloved thanks to his wacky antics and superhuman strength upon downing a can of spinach. — Joseph Stanichar\n34. Phineas and Ferb Created: 2007 Creators: Dan Povenmire, Jeff “Swampy” Marsh Voices: Vincent Martella, Thomas Sangster\n“Hey Ferb, I know what we’re going to do today,” Phineas says each show before launching into their latest ambitious plan to pass the summer days, whether it’s building a giant tree house that transforms into a giant robot, filming a movie or creating a time machine. And even though the stepbrothers’ grand plans escape the attention of their parents and drive Candace nuts, Phineas and Ferb remain completely guileless. Hard to believe this was on the Disney Channel. — Josh Jackson\n33. Garnet ( Steven Universe ) Created: 2013 Creator: Rebecca Sugar Voice: Estelle\nRevealed to be a fusion of two other characters, Ruby and Sapphire, Garnet is the embodiment of empowerment. A manifestation of these characters’ queer relationship, she has both the ability to see into the future and kick serious ass to change it. Nowhere is this as evident as in her fight song, “Made of Love,” in which she taunts her opponent while explaining how her bond is unbreakable. More than any other character in Steven Universe Garnet is completely unafraid to be herself, no matter what others think of her. — Joseph Stanichar\n32. Bobby Hill ( King of the Hill ) Created: 1997 Creator: Mike Judge Voice: Pamela Adlon\nHank might think his boy ain’t right, but he’s just fine by us. We like his self-confidence that doesn’t depend on innate talent or beauty. He’s comfortable in his own skin, and that often makes his daddy uncomfortable. — Josh Jackson\n31. Betty Boop Created: 1930 Creators: Max Fleischer, Grim Natwick Voices: Margie Hines, Mae Questel, various others\nThough Betty seems like a product of the Roaring ’20s, it’s important to remember that she was actually the Queen of the Depression Era, a sexy reminder of better times and an avatar for a younger generation. — Josh Jackson\n30. She-Ra Created: 1985 Creators: Larry DiTillio, J. Michael Straczynski Voices: Melendy Britt, Aimee Carrero\nOriginally designed as a female counterpart to the ’80s cartoon superhero He-Man, She-Ra became a character with her own following and successful TV series, despite its corniness. However, the heroine got an unlikely reboot through Netflix in 2018, telling a much more complex and emotionally resonant story in Princesses of Power that took the likely accidental queer undertones of He-Man’s universe and translated them into intentionally queer-coded characters. — Joseph Stanichar\n29. Korra ( Avatar: The Legend of Korra ) Created: 2012 Creators: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko Voice: Janet Varney\nThe next Avatar after The Last Airbender ’s Aang, Korra represented a slightly older, more mature reincarnation of the master of earth, water, fire and air. Instead of one evil Fire Lord to face off against, Korra spends the entirety of her series fighting to understand and address the problems facing Republic City and the world, while also discovering her own legacy and path. Her final scene in which she holds hands with another female character, Asami, may seem to be an understated form of LGBTQ+ representation when compared to others on this list, but it was an important first step that paved the way for future representation. — Joseph Stanichar\n28. Pinky & the Brain ( Animaniacs ) Created: 1995 Creator: Tom Ruegger Voices: Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche\nPlenty of cartoon characters have had ambitions for world domination, but no one else just wanted to be a benevolent dictator like The Brain. His not-so-reliant sidekick Pinky may cause The Brain constant headaches, but his enthusiasm and loyalty make him impossible not to love. — Josh Jackson\n27. Bart Simpson ( The Simpsons ) Created: 1987 Creator: Matt Groening Voice: Nancy Cartwright\nEvery principal’s nightmare, this merry prankster’s only two real talents are skateboarding and troublemaking. — Josh Jackson\n26. Harley Quinn Created: 1992 Creator: Paul Dini, Bruce Timm Voices: Arleen Sorkin, Kaley Cuoco, various others\nIn an unconventional twist, Harley Quinn made her debut not in a comic book, but in the cartoon series Batman: The Animated Series . “In the script she was just an unnamed Joker “hench-wench” w/ no discernible personality,” Joker voice actor Mark Hamill shared recently . “When Arleen began reading her lines in that unforgettable voice so poignant & full of heart I nearly fell off my chair! She brought SO much more than was on the page & a legend was born.” That legend has continued through the villainess’ own adult-oriented series, starting in 2019. — Joseph Stanichar\n25. Wile E. Coyote ( Looney Tunes ) Created: 1949 Creators: Chuck Jones, Michael Maltese Voices: Mel Blanc, Seth MacFarlane, various others\nCharlie Brown will never kick his football, and Wile E. will never catch the Roadrunner. These are among the first truths learned by any kid in America, even as they’re exposed to the beauties of the Western desert. His clever plans and box of oft-malfunctioning ACME tricks resulted in our favorite coyote falling off cliffs, getting crushed by stones, and at the center of crater-inducing explosions; no cartoon character suffered more for our entertainment. — Josh Jackson\n24. Mordecai and Rigby ( Regular Show ) Created: 2010 Creator: J.G. Quintel Voices: J.G. Quintel, William Salyers\n“Don’t look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches!” That’s one of many lines from this duo that doesn’t make much more sense within context but is just as enjoyable. The 23-year-old blue jay and racoon have too much time on their hands and fill it by doing increasingly ridiculous and fantastical stunts, often going from mundane hijinks to galaxy-bending sci-fi within each episode. — Joseph Stanichar\n23. Scrooge McDuck ( DuckTales ) Created: 1947 Creator: Carl Barks Voices: Dallas McKennon, Bill Thompson, Alan Young, David Tennant, various others\nScrooge McDuck has appeared in a dizzying number of Disney stories over the years, cementing his icon status as he stole the spotlight from nephew Donald and grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Virulently anti-scallywag, hopelessly misanthropic, often seen diving into his pool of gold, Scrooge is laughing all the way to the bank. — Allison Keene\n22. Rick and Morty Created: 2013 Creators: Justin Roiland, Dan Harmon Voice: Justin Roiland\nBased on a crude animation of Back to the Future ’s Marty and Doc, Kayla Cobb described Rick and Morty best when she called it a “never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism.” The pubescent Morty goes on trips throughout dimensions with his alcoholic, jaded grandfather Rick, who sees himself as an unstoppable force despite his underlying insecurities. Sadly, too many fans get the wrong lessons from Rick, unironically idolizing his toxic behavior . — Joseph Stanichar\n21. Tina Belcher ( Bob’s Burgers ) Created: 2011 Creator: Loren Bouchard Voice: Dan Mintz\nWith her anxious groans and her freaky friend fiction, Tina Belcher encapsulates the confused horny sadness of being a teen. That, plus her compassion and active imagination, often makes her the very heart of the excellent Bob’s Burgers . — Rae Nudson\n20. Fred Flintstone ( The Flintstones ) Created: 1960 Creators: William Hanna, Joseph Barbera Voices: Alan Reed, Jeff Bergman, various others\nThe patriarch of his modern stone-age family, Fred proved that cartoons weren’t just for kids. Although the original series may seem tame by modern standards (and the Flintstones today are more known for promoting cereal and vitamins) it was among the most risque shows on TV in the ’60s. — Josh Jackson\n19. Dr. Doofenshmirtz ( Phineas and Ferb ) Created: 2007 Creators: Dan Povenmire, Jeff “Swampy” Marsh Voice: Dan Povenmire\nHe may act like an evil scientist, but the truth is that Dr. Doofenshmirtz isn’t actually that bad — or smart. We love his back-story monologues about his childhood in Gimelschtump, Druselstien. We love his ridiculously named devices (the Ugly-Inator, the Age-Acclerator-Inator) and that his nemesis is a platypus. The subtleties of the relationship are pitch-perfect. When Perry busts in on Doofenshmirtz when his blind date is about to arrive, Perry accommodates his rival by pretending to be his pet (“She doesn’t know I have a nemesis”). And most of all, we love his songs. — Josh Jackson\n18. Eric Cartman ( South Park ) Created: 1997 Creators: Trey Parker, Matt Stone Voice: Trey Parker\nWho else but Eric Cartman could inspire 10 parallels with Ambrose Bierce’s The Devil’s Dictionary ? This selfish, foul-mouthed, hippie-hating, cartoon brat is the antithesis of political correctness; an Archie Bunker for a new generation. Over the last two-and-a-half decades, he’s been the perfect vehicle for broaching taboos Americans are too terrified to engage in polite conversation. — Josh Jackson\n17. Rocky and Bullwinkle ( The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle ) Created: 1959 Creators: Jay Ward, Alex Anderson, Bill Scott Voice: June Foray, Bill Scott\nThe animation might not have been fancy, but the scripts were funny as Rocky and Bullwinkle fended off threats from the very Eastern European-sounding Pottsylvania. — Josh Jackson\n16. Sterling Archer ( Archer ) Created: 2009 Creator: Adam Reed Voice: H. Jon Benjamin\nJames Bond with Mommy issues, Sterling Archer’s crass debauchery made for some of the best transgressive and subversive antics on TV, but only because a surprising compassion would occasionally pop through his narcissistic playboy exterior. And as he’s done in Home Movies , Bob’s Burger’s , Family Guy and so many other animated comedies, H. Jon Benjamin’s performance will constantly have you laughing as Archer casually drinks his way through another misguided spy mission. — Josh Jackson\n15. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup ( The Powerpuff Girls ) Created: 1998 Creator: Craig McCracken Voices: Cathay Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, various others\nThe ultimate vanguard of “you can be cute and still kick ass,” the funny and fierce Powerpuff Girls arrived on the 90s cartoon scene ready to inspire and delight a generation. No matter who you individually identified with the most, the ultimate lesson was that working together is the strongest play. — Allison Keene\n14. Winnie the Pooh Created: 1926 Creators: A. A. Milne, E. H. Shepard Voice: Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith, Jim Cummings\nBeloved as he was in book form, for many, Winnie-the-Pooh’s Disney adventures are the best remembered iterations of this Silly Ol’ Bear. Beyond his big heart and inherent sweetness, Winnie the Pooh also normalized having an insatiable sweet tooth. — Allison Keene\n13. Finn the Human and Jake the Dog ( Adventure Time ) Created: 2010 Creator: Pendleton Ward Voices: Jeremy Shada, John DiMaggio\nYou just can’t separate this dynamic duo, our two plucky heroes from the Land of Ooo whose humor, pathos, loyalty, and bravery elevated this wonderful, surreal, emotionally-deep series into must-see status for all ages. — Allison Keene\n12. BoJack Horseman Created: 2014 Creator: Raphael Bob-Waksberg Voice: Will Arnett\nWill Arnett’s anthropomorphized, misanthropic horse has one of the most complicated, profound and deeply felt redemption arcs of any TV character in history. He was damaged and caused damage wherever he went, but we could love him even when he didn’t love himself. Never has a cartoon tackled such deep and difficult topics with such a deft hand. That it was also consistently hilarious was a bonus, and at the heart of it all was a washed-up ’90s sitcom actor struggling in the wake of his fame. — Josh Jackson\n11. Steven Universe Created: 2013 Creator: Rebecca Sugar Voice: Zach Callison\nMost cartoon characters never grow up, staying the same youthful age no matter how many seasons their show gets. Not so with Steven Universe. Rebecca Sugar’s titular character grows up almost in real time, acquiring new powers and learning more about himself as the son of a human and magical gem from an alien planet. This is heightened in the sequel series Steven Universe Future , in which the now 16-year-old Steven struggles with mental health issues rarely discussed in cartoons for any age. In a show all about loving yourself for who you are, Steven demonstrates how difficult that can actually be. — Joseph Stanichar\n10. Zuko ( Avatar: The Last Airbender ) Created: 2005 Creators: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko Voice: Dante Basco\nThat’s right: Not Aang, but Zuko! Watching Zuko’s first and last episodes, they don’t even seem to be the same character. The former is a stuck-up prince in a ponytail, unable to contain his rage and angst. The latter is a more emotionally intelligent character, embracing his uncle in a teary plea for forgiveness. Yet when watched chronologically, the transformation between the two is seamless. Shaped by both hate and love, Zuko’s story is tragic yet uplifting, creating not only one of the best characters not just in animation, but television as a whole. — Joseph Stanichar\n9. Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello ( Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ) Created: 1984 Creators: Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird Voices: Cam Clarke, Barry Gordon, Rob Paulsen, Townsend Coleman, various others\nFor the purposes of this list, we’re focusing on the OG crew who became iconic for 90s kids, these radical pizza-eating ninja-style fighters with a rat for a sensei, yet elegantly named after some of history’s greatest artists. It’s impossible to pick a “best” turtle for the list, because it’s all down to individual personality. Together, though, they are essential to pop culture history in all of their forms (including as one of the pinnacles of “the show is for the toy”). — Allison Keene\n8. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers Created: 1969 Creators: Joe Ruby, Ken Spears Voices: Casey Kasem, Don Messick, various others\nThey never outright state it, but we’re pretty sure there’s something… hallucinogenic in those “Scooby Snacks.” Juxtaposed with the rest of the Scooby Gang, Shaggy and Scoob seem to be pretty useless, eating and lazing about most of the time and screaming in terror when confronted with anything spooky. And yet they’re the easiest to love. Throughout all of Scooby-Doo ’s many adaptations, this duo of man and dog remains timeless. — Joseph Stanichar\n7. Mickey Mouse Created: 1928 Creators: Walt Disney, Ub Iwerks Voices: Walt Disney, Bret Iwan, various others\nIt’s easy to lose sight of the cartoon character Mickey in the shadow of the mascot for the Disney empire. But there might not be a Disney empire but for the charms of an enthusiastic, adventurous mouse. Nearly a century after Disney’s iconic “Steamboat Willie” short, the mouse will likely enter the public domain in 2024. But after kickstarting an unfathomably rich $173 billion empire, that seems more than fair. — Josh Jackson\n6. SpongeBob Squarepants Created: 1999 Creator: Stephen Hillenburg Voice: Tom Kenny\nThis titular sponge’s nautical nonsense may not be what many kids’ parents wished for, but two decades of being on the air have cemented Tom Kenny’s iconic laugh into the minds of audiences across the globe. Nothing proved this more than when creator Stephen Hillenburg passed away in 2018, igniting a movement to memorialize him at the Super Bowl with the song “Sweet Victory” from one of its best episodes, “Band Geeks.” Fans may have been snubbed there, but Hillenburg’s legacy continues to live on through the naive sponge’s everlasting popularity. — Joseph Stanichar\n5. Tom and Jerry Created: 1941 Creators: William Hanna, Joseph Barbera Voices: William Hanna, various others\nSilent film mostly went away with the advent of the talkies, but Hanna and Barbera’s Tom and Jerry didn’t need dialogue to enrapture generations of children. The 114 shorts were created between 1940 and 1958, but they feel like they belonged to my childhood in the late ’70s, just like they’ll feel like a part of my kids’ childhoods when they grow up alongside the 2014 adaptation of the classic cat-and-mouse hijinks. — Josh Jackson\nCreated: 1934 Creators: Dick Lundy, Walt Disney Voice: Clarence Nash, Tony Anselmo, Daniel Ross\nIrritable, vindictive, never able to let go of a grudge: Donald Duck is the Larry David of cartoons. After debuting in “The Wise Old Hen” alongside Disney also-rans Peter Pig and Clara Cluck on June 9, 1934, Donald quickly lapped Mickey Mouse in popularity after becoming a solo star in 1937, and went on to star in more shorts than any other Disney character. It’s clear why he so transfixed audiences: flaws like his temper, greed, and vanity aren’t just hilarious, but make him more relatable and human than any other classic Disney character. (And geez, he’s basically the horniest cartoon character ever in The Three Caballeros, making Tex Avery’s wolf look like a eunuch.) He might always play second fiddle to the mouse as a corporate logo, but Donald left Mickey in the dust long ago, and is the center of his own sprawling comic and cartoon universe. — Garrett Martin\n3. Charlie Brown and Snoopy ( Peanuts ) Created: 1950 Creator: Charles M. Schulz Voice: Peter Robbins, Bill Melendez, various others\nNot every character survived the move from print to the TV screen, but Charlie Brown and his dog Snoopy absolutely came to life through a handful of TV specials and subsequent series. Snoopy’s Red Baron dreams, friendship with Woodstock and crush on Lucy won the hearts of kids, whereas older audiences connected with Charlie. Hapless Charlie Brown is as sympathetic a character as we’ve ever had, real or animated. Unlucky in love, untalented and trusting to a fault—we pull for him, knowing it’s all for naught. — Josh Jackson\n2. Homer J. Simpson ( The Simpsons ) Created: 1987 Creator: Matt Groening Voice: Dan Castellaneta\nThe first two seasons of The Simpsons were focused on Bart, but as it became Homer-centric, the show became something truly special. He’s the everyman at our laziest, hungriest, dumbest, and drunkest. Yet thanks to good heart buried under all those doughnuts, he’s also the hero that repeatedly saves the day—or at least restores everything to a status quo which has endured for three-and-a-half decades and over thirty Halloween “Treehouse of Horror” specials, the 30th of which aired as the series’ 666th episode. — Josh Jackson\n1. Bugs Bunny ( Looney Tunes ) Created: 1940 Creators: Ben Hardaway, Tex Avery Voices: Mel Blanc, Jeff Bergman, various others\nThe coolest cat in cartoon history is a rabbit. Or a hare. That slight taxonomic difference was never addressed during his many antics, but he held an enviable insouciance through them all, whether being hunted with Elmer Fudd’s shotgun, Yosemite Sam’s pistols or Marvin Martian’s ACME Disintegration Pistol. The familiar face of Warner Bros. only had one flaw: a poor sense of direction (especially when tunneling through New Mexico). — Josh Jackson\nFor all the latest TV news, reviews, lists and features, follow @Paste_TV .\n• 1The trans women Lou Reed left behind\n• 2Spotify won’t say it’s done with ICE\n• 3COVER STORY | Dry Cleaning is a total work of art\n• 4Wolf Parade’sApologies to the Queen Marykeeps finding new people to haunt\n• 5Westside Cowboy: The Best of What's Next",

In the 30s, major studios like Disney, Warner Bros., and Fox produced iconic cartoon characters that became the faces of their companies. In the 70s and 80s, groundbreaking characters debuted in prime time, changing the landscape of animation instantly. In the 90s and beyond, animation continued to introduce legendary cartoon stars that dominated the market.
