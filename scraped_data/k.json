    "plain_text": "Page 1: What is the Capital of China?\nThe largest city in China is Shanghai while Beijing is the capital city. Besides being the capital, Beijing is among the most populated capital city in the world. The national government of China rules the city directly through the municipal government. The name Beijing was chosen in 1403 and means northern capital, a reference to the city's location in the North of China. Beijing will have the distinction of being the only city in the world so far to host both the Summer Olympics, which Beijing hosted in 2008 and the Winter Olympics which it will host in 2022.\nThe History Of Beijing\nThe city's history dates back more than 200,000 years ago to the prehistoric era. This has been determined by the fossils of Homo erectus that have been discovered within the area. In 1045 BC a town named Jicheng was constructed in the location of modern-day Guang'anmen area. At the time it was the capital city of the nation of Ji which was the first of six times that the city would be the capital of a state. The Xianbei kingdom also selected Jicheng as their capital for a brief period after Wu Hu had subjugated the area. During the reign of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Di chose Beijing as his capital replacing Yingtian.\nIt was during the Ming Dynasty rule that some of Beijing's most iconic buildings such as the Forbidden City were constructed. In 1644 an army of peasants put an end to the Ming Dynasty by capturing their capital. In 1949 Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed Beijing as the capital of the newly formed People's Republic of China. Due to the city's long history, UNESCO has listed seven of the city's most iconic structures as World Heritage Sites .\nUrban Development In Beijing\nBeijing is one of the most developed cities in the world with factories, skyscrapers, and large corporations coexisting in the city. The government has invested in transport, particularly road transport, by constructing several ring roads. The city has several shopping districts that have developed over the years and are quite popular with tourists. The urban development has had some negative effects such as the destruction of cultural centres to make space for new buildings, and the heavy traffic caused by a large number of vehicles on the roads.\nThe city has gained notoriety for poor air quality because of a large number of industries in the Hebei region that borders Beijing. The industries' main source of energy is coal which produces noxious fumes after burning. Many homes in Beijing have air filters to ensure that the residents are breathing good quality air. The Chinese government has undertaken various projects to reduce the pollution and improve the city's air quality.\nThe Growth Of Cities In China\nThe Chinese government estimates that more than 300 million people will migrate from rural areas to urban areas by 2025. The people will move mainly in search for jobs that are more available in urban areas. Modern amenities in cities also attract large numbers of migrants. To ensure sustainable development, the Chinese government has undertaken various initiatives, for example, constructing new towns in rural areas to stem the flow of migrants.\n• What is the Capital of China?\nWhat Is The Capital Of The Shanxi Province Of China?\nWhat Is The Capital Of The Yunnan Province Of China?\nPage 2: What Is The Capital Of The Shanxi Province Of China?\nThe city of Taiyuan serves as the provincial capital of Shanxi province . The city is situated at the center of the roughly rectangular shaped province. Taiyuan lies along the strategic north-south route through Shanxi Province and is among China 's major industrial cities. The city also controls vital natural communication lines that go through the mountains to the Shaanxi province to the west and the Hebei Province to the east. The city's strategic role is enhanced by the rail lines to Hebei and Henan provinces as well as expressways to Datong, Shijiazhuang, and Yuncheng.\nThe Shanxi province is bordered by Henan province to the south and southeast, by Hebei to the east, by Shaanxi to the west, and by Inner Mongolia to the north. The term Shanxi translates to \"West of the Mountains” which testifies to the territory’s rugged terrain on the Taihang Mountains . In the past, the province played a crucial role as the buffer between the country and the Mongolian and Central Asian Steppes. It also served as a strategic gateway to fertile lands in Henan and Hebei. The province is home to Heng Shan mountain, one of the five Sacred Mountains of China as well as several of China's UNESCO World Heritage sites .\nTaiyuan was initially the location of Jinyang which was a strategic center used by the ancient states of Zhao and Jin. It later became the seat of the Commandery of Taiyuan in 221 BCE after the conquest Zhao and the neighboring states, a position it held throughout the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). During the Dong Han Period (25-220 CE), Taiyuan became the provincial capital of Bing. In the 6th century, it became a secondary capital to the Dong Wei, Bei, and Qi states making it a large city and the center of Buddhism. The city served as an important base for the founder of the Tang dynasty in his conquest of the empire. When China was reunified in 960, Taiyuan continued its resistance and was destroyed in 979 as a result. In 982, the new Taiyuan city was established at the banks of the Fen River. The city became the capital of Hedong in 1107 and retained the role with several changes in its status and name until the Yuan period came to an end in 1368. The city was renamed to Taiyuan Fu at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty and retained the name until 1912. The city also served as the capital of Shanxi during the Ming and Qing dynasties (1644 -1912). The city was renamed to Yangqu under the Republic and retained the name until 1927.\nTaiyuan has experienced dramatic industrial growth since 1949. The city sits close to considerable iron and coal deposits that have fueled the city's industrial growth. Several industrial districts have been created in the city's outskirts that have large chemical complexes, machine making shops, and iron and steel making industries.\nSome of the notable tourist attractions in the city include the Jinci Temple whose beauty is only rivaled by The Twin-Pagoda Temple's unique architectural design. Anyone visiting the city should also consider visiting the Tainong Shan stone caves that date back to the Tang dynasty and taking part in the Shanxi Taiyuan International Folk Arts Festival.\n• What Is The Capital Of The Shanxi Province Of China?\nWhat Is The Capital Of The Shandong Province Of China?",

    "plain_text": "Pages: 1 Page 1: What is a Psychometric Test? Complete Guide Examples 2025 Psychometric Tests Explained: Complete Guide (2025)Psychometric assessment tests are widely used by employers across the world to assess a candidate's cognitive abilities, personality traits, and job suitability. Whether you're preparing for a psychometric test for a job interview, or looking for psychometric test examples to practice, this guide will help you understand what psychometric tests are, how they work, and how to prepare effectively.What is a Psychometric Test?A psychometric assessment test is a scientific testing method to measure a person's mental capabilities, problem-solving skills, and personality. Employers use psychometric testing to identify the best candidates for a role by assessing skills that are difficult to evaluate through resumes or interviews.Psychometric Test Meaning in RecruitmentWhen applying for a job, you may be required to take a psychometric exam online. Companies use these assessments to ensure that candidates possess the right skills, aptitude, and personality to succeed in a given role. Companies also use psychometric examinations as a means to efficiently screen the hundreds of applications they get in order to identify which candidates to progress to the next round of the recruitment process.Why is a Psychometric Test Conducted? To assess a candidate's skills objectively Unlike resumes and interviews, psychometric testing and assessment provide a non-biased and quantifiable measure of a candidate's abilities. To streamline hiring decisions Companies receive hundreds of applications for a single job. Psychometric tests help shortlist the most suitable candidates efficiently. To ensure a good personality fit Employers use personality tests to evaluate a candidate's behavioral traits, teamwork skills, and leadership potential. To predict job performance Certain aptitude tests help determine whether a candidate can handle job-related challenges.Types of Psychometric Tests1. Cognitive Ability Tests (Aptitude Tests)Aptitude Tests are commonly used to measure a candidate's ability to process information, solve problems, and make logical decisions. Common Types of Aptitude Tests: Numerical Reasoning: Assesses mathematical skills and ability to interpret data and graphs. Verbal Reasoning: Measures reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. Logical Inductive Reasoning: Tests pattern recognition and problem-solving skills. Abstract Reasoning: Evaluates the ability to understand complex relationships between symbols and shapes.2. Personality and Behavioral AssessmentsPersonality Tests are commonly used to analyze personality traits, work styles, and emotional intelligence in order to determine whether a candidate is a good cultural fit and how they are expected to react and perform in different scenarios. Common Personality Tests: The Big Five Personality Traits (the Five-Factor Model) - Measures Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Situational Judgment Tests (SJT) Measures decision-making in work scenarios. Emotional Intelligence Tests Assess self-awareness and interpersonal skills. Saboteur Assessment Identifies negative thought patterns and behaviors that can hinder your progress and wellbeing.3. Job-Specific Psychometric TestsSome jobs in industries such as engineering, aviation, and deep-tech require specialized psychometric exams tailored to specific roles. Mechanical Reasoning Tests - Engineering roles. PILAPT, COMPASS or CUT-E Tests - Aviation roles. Leadership and Management Assessments - Corporate and Executive roles. Psychometric Test Examples with AnswersHere are some common psychometric test questions with answers:1. Numerical Reasoning Test ExampleThis test measures math skills, data analysis, and problem-solving abilities. Questions usually include ratios, percentages, currency conversions, and graphs.Example Numerical Reasoning Psychometric Question:A store sells a laptop for 1,200 after applying a 20 discount. What was the original price? a) 1,300 b) 1,400 c) 1,500 d) 1,600In order to work out the original price, we must take the after discount price of 1,200 and gross it up by the 20 discount provided.Hence the answer is 1,200 (1 - 20) 1,200 80 1,500 (Option C).2. Verbal Reasoning Test ExampleThis test assesses reading comprehension, logical reasoning, and critical thinking. Questions usually come in the form of a passage, followed by a series of statements in which candidates identify whether each statement is True, False or Cannot Say. When answering questions, candidates must remember to only use the information provided in the passage and not any background knowledge, no matter how counter intuitive it may be.Example Verbal Reasoning Psychometric Question:\"All engineers are good at mathematics. Some mathematicians are engineers.\" Which statement is correct? a) All mathematicians are engineers b) Some engineers are mathematicians c) All engineers are mathematicians d) None of the aboveLet us go through each answer individually:a) From the second part of the sentence, we are provided the info that only some mathematicians are engineers, hence the statement that all mathematicians are engineers is in direct contradiction to this and thus incorrect.b) The second part of the sentence states that some mathematicians are engineers, hence it follows from this that the other side of this is also correct. In other words, some engineers are also mathematicians.c) Whilst the first part of the sentence states that all engineers are good at mathematics, this does not mean they are all mathematicians. The second part of the sentence states that some mathematicians are engineers, but there is not enough information to conclude that ALL engineers are mathematicians.Hence, the correct answer is Option b) Some engineers are mathematicians.3. Logical Reasoning Test ExampleThis test measures pattern recognition, abstract thinking, and problem-solving. Questions usually include shapes, patterns, and sequences for which candidates must determine the next shape in the sequence.Example Logical Reasoning Psychometric Question:Which shape follows in this sequence?The shape alternates between a star (with an increasing number of points from 4 to 5 to 6), and a four-sided shape in between the stars to complete the sequence. Given the last shape in the sequence is a star, the next shape must be a 4 sided shape. From the options provided, the only 4 sided shape is Option C which is the correct answer.4. Abstract Reasoning Test Example This test is similar to the Logical Reasoning Test and also evaluates visual problem-solving and pattern recognition skills. Questions usually include shapes and patterns for which you need to identify the sequence.Example Abstract Reasoning Psychometric Question:Which shape follows in this sequence?If we look at the difference between the first and second shape, we can see that a dot gets added on the 1st edge and 3rd edge counting clockwise. For the second shape, starting on the last dot that was added on the 3rd edge, again dots are added on the 1st edge and the 3rd edge. This repeats itself the entire sequence.Working through the remaining shapes, we can see in the 5th picture that the last dot was added on the bottom right edge. As such, the next shape in the pattern would have dots added on the 1st edge (bottom left) and 3rd edge (top edge). Hence, the correct answer is Option D.5. Mechanical Spatial Test ExampleThis test is used for engineering, aviation, and technical jobs. Questions usually include mechanical principles, tool usage, and spatial awareness.Example Mechanical Spatial Psychometric Question:For a given Gear A and Gear B that are connected and touching each other at one point. If Gear A rotates clockwise, which direction will Gear B rotate? a) Clockwise b) Counterclockwise c) It won't move d) Not enough informationOption B) Counterclockwise, as gears rotate in opposite directions when connected directly.6. Situational Judgment Test (SJT) ExampleThis test assesses decision-making, teamwork, and leadership skills. Candidates must choose the best response to common workplace scenarios and day to day life decisions.Example Situational Judgment Question:Your colleague misses a deadline, causing delays. What do you do? a) Report them to your manager b) Offer to help them complete the task c) Ignore the situation d) Complain to another colleagueOption B) Offer to help, as this demonstrates teamwork and problem-solving skills. The other options don't result in a good outcome for anyone involved.Psychometric Test Practice and Preparation 1.

Employer of Record (EOR) services have emerged as a revolutionary approach to global workforce management, enabling businesses to hire and manage employees in foreign markets without establishing a local legal entity. Nepal, with its strategic location, skilled workforce, and growing economy, has positioned itself as an attractive destination for businesses looking to expand their operations in South Asia.The traditional approach to international expansion often involves complex legal procedures, substantial upfront investments, and lengthy compliance processes. However, EOR services in Nepal offer a streamlined alternative that allows companies to focus on their core business activities while ensuring full compliance with local employment laws and regulations. This comprehensive guide explores how EOR services are transforming business expansion strategies and why Nepal represents an exceptional opportunity for forward-thinking organizations.Table of ContentsWhat Is an Employer of Record (EOR)?An Employer of Record (EOR) is a third-party organization that serves as the legal employer for a companys workforce in a specific jurisdiction. The EOR assumes all legal and administrative responsibilities associated with employment, including payroll processing, tax compliance, benefits administration, and adherence to local labor laws. This arrangement allows companies to hire employees in foreign markets without establishing their own legal entity.The fundamental difference between EOR services and traditional outsourcing lies in the employment relationship. While outsourcing involves contracting work to external providers, EOR services create a direct employment relationship between the EOR and the employee on behalf of the client company. This distinction is crucial for maintaining control over business operations while ensuring complete legal compliance.Unlike Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs), which typically require the client company to have an existing legal presence, EOR providers can facilitate hiring without any prior establishment in the target market. This flexibility makes EOR services particularly valuable for companies testing new markets or seeking rapid expansion without significant upfront investments.Why Choose Nepal for EOR Services?Nepal offers a compelling environment for global companies to hire talent and expand operations:Industry Growth : Key sectors like tech, BPO , pharmaceuticals, and development organizations are growing steadily.Skilled Talent : A rising number of professionals in IT, finance, engineering, and administrative fields.Cost Efficiency : Lower operational and labor costs compared to neighboring markets.English Proficiency : A significant portion of the workforce is fluent in English.Time Zone Compatibility : Nepals time zone complements both Asian and Western markets.How EOR Services Work in Nepal: Step-by-Step Process Consultation: The EOR provider begins with a detailed consultation to understand your hiring plans, budget, number of roles, and compliance expectations.

Payroll Benefits: The EOR manages monthly payroll processing, ensures employees receive statutory benefits like Social Security Fund contributions, health insurance (if applicable), and calculates accurate tax deductions per Nepalese law. Compliance Management: Staying up to date with changing labor laws and tax codes can be difficult. The EOR ensures that your workforce is always in compliance with national regulations, including leave entitlements, tax submissions, and labor audits. Ongoing HR Support: The EOR becomes the day-to-day point of contact for employee administration handling queries, leave management, disciplinary action processes, and regular performance documentation as required. Exit Final Settlement: When an employee leaves, voluntarily or otherwise, the EOR ensures that full and final settlements are legally compliant, including notice periods, severance, tax clearance, and issuance of experience letters.Key Benefits of Using an EOR in Nepal Compliance Assurance: Avoid penalties and stay updated with local laws. Faster Market Entry: Hire in weeks instead of months. Administrative Relief: Focus on core operations while the EOR handles HR tasks.

New trends and considerations are shaping the way businesses approach outsourcing. Here is a comprehensive guide to help you choose the best outsourcing company for your business in 2024.Why Best Outsourcing Company is important in 2024Outsourcing remains a popular strategy because it allows companies to focus on their core competencies while delegating other functions to experts. With increasing economic pressures and also with the rapid advancements in technology, businesses are more motivated than ever to outsource tasks such as IT services, customer support, HR, finance, and more. This model not only saves costs but also provides access to cutting-edge technologies and expertise.Key Factors to Consider When Choosing an Outsourcing Company1. Define Your Goals and ObjectivesBefore you even begin the search for an outsourcing partner, its important to have a clear understanding of your companys goals. Whether you are looking to reduce costs, improve efficiency, or even access specific expertise, having well-defined objectives will help you choose the right outsourcing company that aligns with your business strategy. Assess your needs and determine which functions are best suited for outsourcing. Make sure the outsourcing company you choose is capable of delivering the results you expect.2. Industry Expertise and SpecializationThe best outsourcing company you select should have a proven track record in your industry. Different industries have different challenges and regulatory requirements, so it is essential that the outsourcing provider is familiar with the specific needs of your business.3. Technology and InfrastructureThe technological capabilities of an outsourcing company are critical in 2024. As businesses move toward digital transformation, outsourcing companies must be equipped with the latest technology tools and automation systems. A company that is using outdated systems may hinder your progress and make your business less competitive.4. Scalability and FlexibilityThe best outsourcing company is one that can scale its services to meet your businesss changing needs. Whether you are expanding or downsizing, the outsourcing company should be able to adjust its resources accordingly. Flexibility is a key consideration, especially if your business operates in a volatile market.5. Cultural CompatibilityWhile technical skills are important, cultural compatibility should not be overlooked. The outsourcing partner should align with your companys values, work ethic, and communication style. Effective communication is very important for maintaining a healthy partnership, especially when dealing with teams in different time zones and regions.Language barriers, cultural differences, and misaligned working hours can negatively affect project outcomes. Choose a provider that has experience working with international clients and can adapt to your companys working style.6. Data Security and Compliance In 2024, data security is a top concern for businesses, especially with increasing cyber threats and stringent data protection laws. When choosing an outsourcing company, it is important to ensure that they have robust security protocols in place to safeguard your sensitive data.The outsourcing partner should comply with relevant regulatory requirements . They should have a solid understanding of data privacy laws, and their infrastructure should be equipped with encryption, firewalls, and other security measures.7. Cost vs. ValueWhile outsourcing is often pursued as a cost-saving measure, focusing solely on cost can lead to poor outcomes. Its essential to consider the value that the outsourcing company provides, not just the price.A value-based approach considers factors like quality of service, long-term benefits, and reliability. Evaluate the potential ROI when comparing outsourcing companies rather than just focusing on the lowest bid.8. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and TransparencyWhen entering into an outsourcing agreement, its important to have clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that define the scope of work, timelines, quality expectations, and penalties for non-compliance. SLAs should be detailed and transparent to avoid misunderstandings and ensure accountability.Ask the outsourcing provider to share performance metrics and KPIs regularly to track their progress. Transparency in reporting and open communication are important for building trust and ensuring that the partnership is successful.9. References and Case StudiesOne of the best ways to evaluate an outsourcing companys reliability is by reviewing references and case studies. Ask for client testimonials, and if possible, speak with other businesses that have worked with the provider. This will give you insights into the companys strengths and weaknesses, as well as their ability to deliver on promises.Check for any industry awards, certifications, or other credentials that demonstrate the outsourcing providers credibility.10. Trial Periods and Pilot ProjectsBefore committing to a long-term outsourcing contract, consider starting with a trial period or pilot project. This allows you to test the outsourcing companys capabilities, workflows, and communication. It can help you gauge whether the provider is a good fit for your business without the risks associated with a full-scale commitment.ConclusionChoosing the best outsourcing company in 2024 involves a careful evaluation of various factors, including expertise, scalability, technology, and cultural alignment. By considering these elements, you can find a partner that not only meets your current needs but also supports your business growth in the long term.

Quick and easy to administer at scale, psychometric tests are an excellent way to reduce the size of the applicant pool.The tests enable employers to confidently siphon the top 510 of candidates, who have displayed that they possess key transferable skills. This streamlining speeds up the recruitment process, providing a logical candidate shortlist of manageable length and reducing HR costs.The online tests are considered to be reliable indicators of candidate potential and suitability, as a strong correlation between a high score and subsequent high-quality performance in role has been identified.Verbal and numerical reasoning tests tend to be most popular with employers, as they test key transferable comprehension and arithmetic skills. The testing of accuracy under pressure gives an indication as to how the candidate will cope in a demanding everyday role.Although prospective employees may be inclined to loathe the impersonal nature of standardised testing, it does bring objectivity back into the recruitment process.Whilst psychometric testing may be an initially daunting prospect, remember that unlike some recruitment stages it can be comprehensively prepared for to avoid any unpleasant surprises.Practising the psychometric tests you are likely to encounter will ensure that, come assessment day, you achieve the high scores that reflect both your ability and potential.The main types of psychometric testsHere at Practice Aptitude Tests, we have broken down the structure and content of the different types of psychometric tests commonly encountered in the recruitment process. Explore the detail of each by reviewing the list below, so you know exactly what to expect from each type of ability test.Numerical ReasoningNumerical reasoning tests demonstrate your ability to deal with numbers quickly and accurately. The questions are not testing high-level ability, but your capacity to use simple mathematical concepts to analyse data and draw conclusions. They assess your knowledge of ratios, percentages, number sequences , data interpretation , financial analysis and currency conversion .Mechanical Reasoning Mechanical reasoning tests challenge your understanding and application of mechanical concepts. You will be required to deduce the elements at work in a particular scenario and answer a directly related question. Usually specific to the sector, they require an element of background knowledge and experience. Common topics include forces, energy, electrics and gears.Logical ReasoningMade up of non-verbal content, logical reasoning tests assess your ability to interpret shapes, numbers and patterns. Candidates must identify the next figure in the sequence from a selection of possibilities. These tests commonly encompass elements from both diagrammatic and numerical reasoning assessments.Verbal ReasoningVerbal reasoning tests assess your comprehension and interpretation of written passages. A short excerpt of text is provided for review and candidates are then asked questions relating to its content. Typically, you will be presented with a series of statements which make certain inferences and tasked to deduce whether each statement is True, False, or if you Cannot Say.Diagrammatic ReasoningTesting pure logical reasoning, diagrammatic tests involve the analysis of sequences of shapes and patterns. You will be required to identify the rule that governs the sequence in order to choose the next correct element from a provided selection, or to correctly apply the rule to a new scenario.Abstract ReasoningAbstract reasoning tests measure your ability to deduce the relationships between shapes and within patterns. They do not require any numerical or verbal analysis, but test your logic and lateral thinking, alongside your accuracy and speed.Spatial ReasoningA spatial reasoning or awareness test is used to assess your ability to identify patterns, visualise movements and mentally manipulate 2D or 3D objects. Common questions include identifying which image is a rotation of a given shape and which net corresponds to a certain 3D image.Situational Judgement AssessmentsSituational judgement tests are used to assess how you would approach different practical situations that may arise in the workplace. Your response to a series of hypothetical scenarios helps employers to judge whether your behaviour and attitude aligns with company expectation and ethos.What to expect when taking a psychometric testAny type of psychometric test will require you to answer multiple-choice questions within a given time limit (though sometimes personality tests have no time limit). Both test length and time provision will vary depending upon test type and provider.As psychometric tests are an assessment of mental agility, you will need to be prepared to answer the questions rapidly without compromising accuracy.If the number of questions seems overly ambitious in the given time, it may be that the test is intended to be ambitious. Focus on correctly answering the questions rapidly, but do not rush in order to finish the test. It is common for multiple psychometric tests to be administered in the same session. For example, you may be required to sit a verbal reasoning test, followed by a numerical reasoning and a situational judgement assessment.Knowing as much as possible about the test structure beforehand will help you pin down the specifics of what to expect.Once you find out that psychometric testing forms part of the job application process, enquire with your prospective employer as to the number and type of tests, along with the provider used. While they may not be able to reveal the provider to you, it is worth an ask given the variation between tests of the same type.Whilst a select few employers may still administer paper versions, expect to sit your psychometric test(s) online. This will either be remotely (in your own home) or as part of an assessment centre (most common for graduate scheme applications). For tests that are sat at home, you will be provided with a time window (usually around 48 hours) in which to take the test.Some tests use adaptive algorithms, adjusting the difficulty based on your previous answers. If youre answering correctly, expect the questions to get tougher as you move forward in the test. This method ensures the test is challenging and accurately assesses your ability level.How to prepare for your psychometric testA high score on your psychometric test means a greater chance of securing a coveted chance to impress at interview, so adequate preparation is key. For all psychometric tests, the best form of preparation is a copious amount of practice.Once you have found out all you can about the type of test being set and the way it is being administered, settle into targeted question practice. This will reveal your strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to focus more time on improving your weakest areas.Working through sample questions and answers will help you to understand the logic of the test and the method of thinking required to rapidly identify the correct answers.Online practice will help you to become accustomed to the timing of the test. This will enable you to become better at achieving the right pace, ensuring full completion of the test with both speed and accuracy.You can access our our Free Psychometric Tests .

Page 5: Saville Assessment: Free Practice Tests Answers (2026) Saville Assessment Assessments 18 tests 207 questionsPreviously known as Saville Consulting, and now part of Willis Towers Watson, Saville Assessment is a global business management consultancy and talent acquisition firm. It is well known for its psychometric tests and personality questionnaires, which are used widely by employers around the world, and in multiple industries.What is a Saville test?A Saville test can come in one of many forms, but all are used by hiring organisations to assess a candidates suitability for a given role.Its psychometric aptitude tests cover all areas of ability, including verbal, numerical, logical and mechanical aptitude. In some cases these are taken as stand-alone assessments; more commonly, they are combined to form a blended assessment, which Saville publishes under its Swift series.As the company was founded by Professor Peter Saville, co-founder of SHL, Saville tests are similar to SHL tests . Both consist of questions containing information similar to what a test taker would expect in their line of work.Saville also publishes situational judgement tests, and personality questionnaires under the Wave banner. The latter are highly regarded as one of the most reliable indicators of a candidates working style and personal preferences.Saville aptitude testsAs mentioned, Saville aptitude tests can be taken on their own or as part of a Swift assessment. A Swift assessment is a quick-fire test covering various areas, lasting from 9.5 to 24 minutes.Single assessments focus on a particular skill and tend to take longer to complete. The following covers all the different types of aptitude tests you may encounter if invited to complete a Saville assessment.Numerical aptitudeSavilles numerical aptitude tests require that you draw fact-based conclusions from statistical information. Youll need to pick the right option from a set of multiple-choice answers by interpreting data in the form of tables and graphs.As a standalone assessment, you may sit the numerical analysis aptitude test, a 24-minute test used for high-level roles and graduate positions.Alternatively you may be asked to take the numerical comprehension aptitude test, a 16-minute test designed for entry-level roles, similar in style but less complex in subject matter.Verbal aptitudeAs with numerical aptitude, there are two main versions of Saville verbal aptitude tests : one for entry-level roles, and one for higher-level positions.The 24-minute verbal analysis aptitude test is commonly used for professional, management and graduate roles. Youll be given paragraphs of text, and asked to answer true, false, or cannot say on a series of statements based on the evidence within the written prompt.The 16-minute verbal comprehension aptitude test is used for entry-level roles, and combines questions as above with word-definition problems.Diagrammatic aptitudeIn the diagrammatic test , youll be given a series of operators: inputs, processes and outputs. Questions come in the form of diagrams that show the operators in action. Your task is to identify which operators result in the illustrated outcome. Youll also be tasked with finding faults and comparing flowchart sequences, with 24 minutes to work through the test. Theres also a shorter, slightly easier version which focuses solely on operators.Mechanical aptitudeThe Saville mechanical aptitude test measures your understanding of physical principles and is used for technical roles of all kinds.Youll be challenged on mechanical concepts like force and direction, and will need to choose the right multiple-choice answer based on illustrations involving things like gears, pulleys and levers.Individual tests take 16 minutes to complete. When part of a Swift assessment, mechanical aptitude is commonly measured alongside diagrammatic and spatial aptitude .Abstract aptitudeAbstract aptitude tests are designed to measure your logical thinking, by assessing how well you can identify rules and relationships in patterns and sequences.In the Saville version, youll have 16 minutes to work through as many patterns as possible, in which part of the pattern has been removed. Youll need to select the right multiple-choice option to fill the gap.Spatial aptitudeOne of the shorter standalone tests, this eight-minute assessment looks at your spatial awareness when working with shapes.Each question involves four objects. In some cases, these will be shown at different angles, and in some cases not. Youll need to examine the objects to identify the odd one out.Differences can be subtle, so this test takes a keen eye.Error checking aptitudeOn its own, the error checking assessment takes just six minutes to complete. It is used for entry-level roles and evaluates a candidates ability to identify errors in numerical, verbal and coding information that has been transposed.Youll be given original information and transposed information and asked to check for accuracy. In some cases there will be no errors, and in others multiple mistakes.This is a fast-paced test that requires both speed and attention to detail. There are also longer versions designed for specific professions.Workplace EnglishThis test is only administered as a standalone exam, so you wont find it as part of a Swift assessment (though you may be asked to take it alongside).Candidates will see multiple sentences relating to workplace scenarios. In each sentence, a word will be missing, and youll need to choose the correct word to complete the sentence from multiple-choice options.Youll have 16.5 minutes to answer as many questions as you can.Saville situational judgement testsSaville situational judgement tests offer employers insight into how well a candidate fits within their organisation, by measuring their personal response to a range of specifically designed hypothetical scenarios.Questions revolve around a realistic workplace situation, to which candidates are given a response and asked to rate how effective they deem this action to be.The exact nature of your situational judgement test will be dependent on the hiring organisation, as these are designed to suit each employer on a test-by-test basis.Wave personality questionnaire Savilles Wave personality assessments use complex rating systems to measure an individuals working styles, preferences and behavioural tendencies. They are widely considered as one of the strongest indicators of a candidates future performance and culture fit.The Wave series comprises four test types used for differing purposes, but the two commonly used in the recruitment process are Wave Professional Styles and Wave Focus Styles.The only difference between the two is duration. Professional Styles is a 40-minute test, whereas Focus Styles is just 13 minutes long. In both, youll rate statements on a scale of very strongly disagree to very strongly agree.Your responses will be collated into in-depth reports that detail your working personality in terms of things like problem solving, relationships and communication.Which employers use Saville tests?Saville is a popular test publisher, owing to its extensive library of assessments. In addition to the tests outlined above and the Swift assessment series, it also offers versions designed for specific sectors.For example, the verbal comprehension aptitude test is administered in unique versions for administrative , operational, commercial and customer service roles.With that in mind, Saville tests are used by numerous employers in a range of different industries.

Extend your vocabulary and language comprehension with word games and critical reading for verbal aptitude, or brush up on basic arithmetic for numerical assessments.Whatever test youre taking, there are activities that will help you build your skill set. 2) Take practice testsThis is vital, as it will help you understand the structure of Saville tests, question formats, and response options. The more familiar you are with the format, the better prepared youll be on the day. Practice tests will also help you work to time constraints.3) Get set upBefore you start your test (if taking unsupervised) make sure youre in a quiet environment and that you wont be interrupted. Check your internet connection and make sure your browsers up to date. Its also a good idea to have a pen and paper on hand, for note-taking or calculations.4) Check detailsNever skim-read questions. This is likely to end up in you missing subtle details imperative to the task at hand. Read every question carefully and thoroughly before you attempt to answer.5) Balance speed and accuracyBoth are important. Employers are looking for attention to detail, but they also want to know you can work with precision under pressure. Try and complete as many questions as you can in the given time frame without compromising on accuracy.Practice Aptitude Tests is not associated with Saville.

Vary your preparationWhile the importance of practising Kenexa tests cant be overstated, there are other ways to prepare yourself mentally. Whether its reading passages of text and getting a friend to ask you questions in preparation for the verbal reasoning, or reading business finance articles to ensure you feel confident with the terminology, it all helps to boost your confidence.2. Read the questions carefullyYou may be under considerable pressure to answer quickly, but failing to read the question properly could cost you more if you dont understand whats being asked of you. Watch out for double negatives in the verbal reasoning test in particular. Little tricks like this might catch you out but not if youre prepared.3. Use logic if you are unsureYoure not always going to be sure of the answer. If thats the case, dont panic. Try to use logic to discount any answers that are not correct. Once left with only two options, its much easier to make an educated guess.4. Check the clock Its easy to get caught up on a tricky question and let time get away from you. At the start of each test, quickly work out how long you have to answer each question, and try your best to stick to it. You can always return to hard questions at the end of the test if you have time remaining.5. Do not get caught outThe questions arent designed to be easy, as employers want to hire the best candidates. So dont let the questions or information given to you in the test catch you out. Some of it may be unnecessary or worded in a way designed to confuse. The more you practice the better youll get at identifying any areas that could trip you up.Practice Aptitude Tests is not associated with Kenexa.

These improvements may be attributed to the enhanced blood flow and increased levels of neurotransmitters in the brain after physical exercise.'With advances in technology, teleworking has become a viable option for many professionals. It offers the flexibility to work from any location and the potential to improve work-life balance. However, it also poses challenges such as potential isolation and the need for self-discipline and effective time management. Physical activity enhances blood flow and neurotransmitter levels, which may improve student performance. Regular physical activity has no impact on students' academic performance or concentration. Physical activity is detrimental to academic performance due to time constraints. Increased levels of neurotransmitters are unnecessary for improved academic performance.Start your success journeyAccess one of our Kenexa tests for FREE.I could prepare for specific companies and industries.

Page 7: Critical Thinking Test Assessment - FREE Tips Questions Critical Thinking Tests 20 tests 228 questionsCritical thinking tests, sometimes known as critical reasoning tests, are often used by employers. They evaluate how a candidate makes logical deductions after scrutinising the evidence provided, while avoiding fallacies or non-factual opinions. Critical thinking tests can form part of an assessment day, or be used as a screening test before an interview.What is a critical thinking test?A critical thinking test assesses your ability to use a range of logical skills to evaluate given information and make a judgement. The test is presented in such a way that candidates are expected to quickly scrutinise the evidence presented and decide on the strength of the arguments.Critical thinking tests show potential employers that you do not just accept data and can avoid subconscious bias and opinions instead, you can find logical connections between ideas and find alternative interpretations.This test is usually timed, so quick, clear, logical thinking will help candidates get the best marks. Critical thinking tests are designed to be challenging, and often used as part of the application process for upper-management-level roles.What does critical thinking mean?Critical thinking is the intellectual skill set that ensures you can process and consider information, challenge and analyse data, and then reach a conclusion that can be defended and justified.In the most simple terms, critical reasoning skills will make sure that you are not simply accepting information at face value with little or no supporting evidence.It also means that you are less likely to be swayed by false news or opinions that cannot be backed with facts which is important in high-level jobs that require logical thinking.For more information about logical thinking, please see our article all about logical reasoning .Which professions use critical thinking tests, and why?Typically, critical thinking tests are taken as part of the application process for jobs that require advanced skills in judgement, analysis and decision making. The higher the position, the more likely that you will need to demonstrate reliable critical reasoning and good logic.The legal sector is the main industry that uses critical thinking assessments making decisions based on facts, without opinion and intuition, is vital in legal matters.A candidate for a legal role needs to demonstrate their intellectual skills in problem-solving without pre-existing knowledge or subconscious bias and the critical thinking test is a simple and effective way to screen candidates.Another industry that uses critical thinking tests as part of the recruitment process is banking. In a similar way to the legal sector, those that work in banking are required to make decisions without allowing emotion, intuition or opinion to cloud coherent analysis and conclusions.Critical thinking tests also sometimes comprise part of the recruitment assessment for graduate and management positions across numerous industries.The format of the test: which skills are tested?The test itself, no matter the publisher, is multiple choice. As a rule, the questions present a paragraph of information for a scenario that may include numerical data. There will then be a statement and a number of possible answers.The critical thinking test is timed, so decisions need to be made quickly and accurately; in most tests there is a little less than a minute for each question. Having experience of the test structure and what each question is looking for will make the experience smoother for you.There are typically five separate sections in a critical thinking test, and each section may have multiple questions.InferenceInference questions assess your ability to judge whether a statement is true, false, or impossible to determine based on the given data and scenario. You usually have five possible answers: absolutely true, absolutely false, possibly true, possibly false, or not possible to determine.AssumptionsIn this section, you are being assessed on your ability to avoid taking things for granted. Each question gives a scenario including data, and you need to evaluate whether there are any assumptions present.DeductionHere you are given a scenario and a number of deductions that may be applicable. You need to assess the given deductions to see which is the logical conclusion does it follow?InterpretationIn the interpretation stage, you need to read and analyse a paragraph of information, then interpret a set of possible conclusions, to see which one is correct. You are looking for the conclusion that follows beyond reasonable doubt.Evaluation of ArgumentsIn this section, you are given a scenario and a set of arguments that can be for or against. You need to determine which are strong arguments and which are weak, in terms of the information that you have. This decision is made based on the way they address the scenario and how relevant they are to the content.How best to prepare for a critical thinking testThe best way to prepare for any type of aptitude test is to practice, and critical thinking tests are no different.Taking practice tests, as mentioned above, will give you confidence as it makes you better understand the structure, layout and timing of the real tests, so you can concentrate on the actual scenarios and questions.Practice tests should be timed. This will help you get used to working through the scenarios and assessing the conclusions under time constraints which is a good way to make sure that you perform quickly as well as accurately.In some thinking skills assessments , a timer will be built in, but you might need to time yourself.Consistent practice will also enable you to pinpoint any areas of the critical thinking test that require improvement. Our tests offer explanations for each answer, similar to the examples provided above.Publishers of critical thinking testsThe Watson Glaser critical thinking test The Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (W-GCTA) is the most popular and widely used critical thinking test. This test has been in development for 85 years and is published by TalentLens .The W-GCTA is seen as a successful tool for assessing cognitive abilities, allowing recruiting managers to predict job success, find good managers and identify future leaders. It is available in multiple languages including English, French and Spanish.The test itself can be used as part of an assessment day or as a screening assessment before an interview. It consists of 40 questions on the 5 sections mentioned above, and is timed at 30 minutes.

A charity that helps homeless people has published data that shows 48 of people that are considered homeless are under 30.The lack of affordable housing on the sales market is the reason so many under-30s are homeless. Definitely True Probably True Impossible to Deduce Probably False Definitely False The information given does not infer the conclusion given, so it is impossible to deduce if the inference is correct there is just not enough information to judge the inference as correct.AssumptionsThe removal of the five-substitution rule in British football will benefit clubs with a smaller roster.Clubs with more money would prefer the five-substitute rule to continue. Assumption Made Assumption Not MadeThis is an example of a fallacy that could cause confusion for a candidate it encourages you to bring in any pre-existing knowledge of football clubs.It would be easy to assume the assumption has been made when you consider that the more money a club has, the more players they should have on the roster. However, the statement does not make the assumption that the clubs with more money would prefer to continue with the five-substitute rule.DeductionAll boys love football. Football is a sport, therefore: All boys love all sports Girls do not love football Boys are more likely to choose to play football than any other sportIn this section we are looking for the conclusion that follows the logic of the statement. In this example, we cannot deduce that girls do not love football, because there is not enough information to support that.In the same way the conclusion that all boys love all sports does not follow we are not given enough information to make that assumption. So, the conclusion that follows is 3: boys are more likely to choose football than any other sport because all boys like football.InterpretationThe British Museum has a range of artefacts on display, including the largest privately owned collection of WWII weaponry.There is a larger privately owned collection of WWII weaponry in the USA. Conclusion Follows Conclusion Does Not FollowConclusion Does Not FollowThe fact that the collection is in the British Museum does not make a difference to the fact it is the largest private collection so there cannot be a larger collection elsewhere.Evaluation of ArgumentsThe Department for Education should lower standards in examinations to make it fairer for less able students. Yes top grades are too hard for lower-income students No less fortunate students are not capable of higher standards Yes making the standards lower will benefit all students No private school students will suffer if grade standards are lower The strongest argument is the right answer, not the one that you might personally believe.In this case, we need to assess which argument is most relevant to the statement. Both 1 and 4 refer to students in particular situations, which isnt relevant to the statement. The same can be said about 2, so the strongest argument is 3, since it is relevant and addresses the statement given.Recommended ReadingIf youre keen to read more, here are some useful resources: Wikipedia Critical ThinkingA thorough overview of critical thinking, including its definitions, components, and importance in reasoning and decision-making.

These departments also showed a higher rate of reaching their quarterly objectives. Strategic decision-making has no link to the achievement of quarterly objectives. Access to advanced analytics does not influence a department's ability to make strategic decisions. Advanced analytics tools are the sole reason for departments reaching their quarterly objectives. Departments without access to advanced analytics tools are unable to make strategic decisions. Advanced analytics tools may facilitate better strategic decision-making, which can lead to the achievement of objectives.After reading the passage below, what conclusion is best supported by the information provided?A companys internal audit revealed that departments with access to advanced analytics tools reported higher levels of strategic decision-making. These departments also showed a higher rate of reaching their quarterly objectives. Job satisfaction increases when employees start their day earlier. Starting early may lead to more efficient task completion and less job-related stress. Workers who start their day later are more efficient at completing tasks. There is a direct correlation between job satisfaction and starting work early. The study concludes that job-related stress is unaffected by the start time of the workday.Based on the passage below, which of the following assumptions is implicit?A companys internal audit revealed that departments with access to advanced analytics tools reported higher levels of strategic decision-making. These departments also showed a higher rate of reaching their quarterly objectives. Inter-departmental cooperation is the sole factor influencing project completion rates. The increase in project completion rates is due entirely to the specialized team-building module. Team-building exercises have no effect on inter-departmental cooperation. The specialized team-building module may contribute to improvements in inter-departmental cooperation. Departments that have not undergone the training will experience a decrease in project completion rates.What is the flaw in the argument presented in the passage below?A companys internal audit revealed that departments with access to advanced analytics tools reported higher levels of strategic decision-making. These departments also showed a higher rate of reaching their quarterly objectives. The assumption that a casual dress code is suitable for all company types. High-tech companies have a casual dress code to increase employee productivity specifically. The argument correctly suggests that a casual dress code will increase employee morale in every company. Morale and productivity cannot be affected by a company's dress code. A casual dress code is more important than other factors in determining a company's success.Which statement is an inference that can be drawn from the passage below?A companys internal audit revealed that departments with access to advanced analytics tools reported higher levels of strategic decision-making. These departments also showed a higher rate of reaching their quarterly objectives. Telecommuting employees are less productive than on-site workers. The reduction in operational costs is directly caused by the increase in telecommuting employees. Telecommuting may have contributed to the decrease in operational costs. Operational costs are unaffected by employee work locations. The number of telecommuting employees has no impact on operational costs.Start your success journeyAccess one of our Watson Glaser tests for FREE.After using the platform for two weeks, Ive never felt more prepared for an Aptitude test.Ethan used Practice Aptitude Tests to improve his situational judgement scores.Hire better talentAt Neuroworx we help companies build perfect teamsCritical Thinking Tests Tips1PracticeThe most important factor in your success will be practice. If you have taken some practice tests, not only will you start to recognise the way questions are worded and become familiar with what each question is looking for, you will also be able to find out whether there are any parts that you need extra practice with.It is important to find out which test you will be taking, as some generic critical thinking practice tests might not help if you are taking specific publisher tests (see the section below).2Fact vs fallacyPractice questions can also help you recognise the difference between fact and fallacy in the test. A fallacy is simply an error or something misleading in the scenario paragraph that encourages you to choose an invalid argument. This might be a presumption or a misconception, but if it isnt spotted it can make finding the right answer impossible.3Ignore what you already knowThere is no need for pre-existing knowledge to be brought into the test, so no research is needed. In fact, it is important that you ignore any subconscious bias when you are considering the questions you need logic and facts to get the correct answer, not intuition or instinct.4Read everything carefullyRead all the given information thoroughly. This might sound straightforward, but knowing that the test is timed can encourage candidates to skip content and risk misunderstanding the content or miss crucial details. During the test itself, you will receive instructions that will help you to understand what is being asked of you on each section. There is likely to be an example question and answer, so ensure you take the time to read them fully.5Stay aware of the time you've takenThis test is usually timed, so dont spend too long on a question. If you feel it is going to take too much time, leave it and come back to it at the end (if you have time).

Page 8: Free Mechanical Reasoning Test Questions To Practice (2026) Mechanical Reasoning Tests 10 tests 80 questionsA mechanical reasoning tests are assessments, often used for technical positions, that measure how candidates apply mechanical principles to solve problems. Mechanical aptitude questions can include gears, electrical circuits, or levers. These tests include a series of images showing mechanical problems or scenarios.What is a mechanical aptitude?Mechanical aptitude, or mechanical reasoning, is the ability to understand and apply mechanical concepts. Mechanical aptitude involves different capacities like spatial ability and is important for technical jobs, including engineering positions and roles in the emergency services and armed forces.What is a mechanical aptitude test?A mechanical reasoning test is an assessment, often used for technical positions, that measures how you apply mechanical principles to solve problems. Mechanical aptitude questions can include gears, electrical circuits, or levers.Typically, candidates will be presented with a series of images showing mechanical problems or scenarios, and must answer questions based on these.The level of difficulty will vary depending on the position applied for. The tests measure your mechanical knowledge rather than underlying aptitude, so if you reach this stage of the process it is expected that you will have a thorough understanding of the key topics and basic principles.Questions are designed to test a candidates ability to apply mechanical reasoning in a practical environment and will generally be industry-specific. So if you were applying for a job with the army, the questions would be based around military scenarios.Why do employers use mechanical reasoning tests?Employers use mechanical aptitude tests to check that applicants have the necessary mechanical knowledge and capabilities to carry out tasks that will be required of them.The ability to apply a range of mechanical concepts is crucial in a number of industries and jobs, including those that involve maintaining, repairing and operating mechanical equipment.Mechanical comprehension tests measure how candidates apply their knowledge in a practical setting, with questions usually based around problems or scenarios they may encounter in the specific industry to which they are applying.Additionally, these tests can offer insights into a candidates potential for learning and adapting to new mechanical systems and technologies, which is increasingly important in rapidly evolving industries. The results can help employers predict not only immediate performance but also long-term growth and adaptability in technical roles.The different types of mechanical reasoning testsEmployers can choose from a number of different test providers, so check which test you will be taking. Below we have outlined some of the most popular mechanical reasoning tests.SHL Verify Mechanical Comprehension Test. This is the most widely used test for mechanical or technical positions, with questions on basic mechanical concepts such as gears, levers and pulleys. It could be used for jobs involving repairing and maintaining machinery, or designing mechanical components. Bennett Test of Mechanical Comprehension (BMCT) . This test is commonly used for engineering and mechanical roles. Along with mechanical comprehension, it assesses spatial visualisation, knowledge of physical forces and mechanical laws, and basic understanding of how machinery works.Wiesen Test of Mechanical Aptitude. This is used for roles where you will be required to operate and service tools and machinery, eg train drivers and aircraft engineers . Topics covered may include levers and pulleys, electronics and gears.Barrons Test of Mechanical Aptitude. This is mostly used as part of the selection process for the military. Questions may include gravity and velocity, hydraulics and shapevolume.Stenquist Test of Mechanical Aptitude. One of the earliest mechanical reasoning tests produced, the Stenquist assessment is picture-based, requiring candidates to choose which picture fits with a group of pictures presented. Knowledge of machinery is a definite advantage.Format of mechanical reasoning testsMechanical reasoning tests are timed assessments and you will generally have around 20 to 30 minutes to answer 20 to 30 questions (so one minute per question).Questions are usually based around mechanical and physical concepts and electrical principles, but you may also be assessed on your spatial reasoning skills and basic mathematics. These tests may be administered separately from the mechanical reasoning but will be included in the same testing session.For the mechanical reasoning tests, you will be given an image depicting a mechanical or electrical scenario with a question related to this. As mentioned previously, these questions may be specific to the sector, meaning they will refer to a situation you are likely to encounter in the role you have applied for.For military and emergency services roles, the mechanical reasoning test is more likely to focus on measuring your basic understanding and ability to apply key principles. However, for a technical or craft job you may be expected to make calculations.Some questions may also require you to select the best tool for a specific job.There are a range of topics that could be included in mechanical reasoning tests. Below we have listed the most popular subjects. Circuits series, parallel Magnetism Circuit diagrams Voltage, current, resistance, capacitors and charge Forces and motions torque, acceleration, pressure, gravity, velocity, momentum, etc Energy potential, magnetic, kinetic, thermal; work and power Springs, gears, pulleys, levers, etc Calculation of areas Conventions and units Tools, terminology Basic mathematics such asfractions,ratios,percentagesand averagesJump to a section on this page: What is a mechanical aptitude?

Find a quiet environment with minimal distractions and make sure you stick to the time limit. This will keep you more focused and will make the real assessment less daunting.4Try things out for yourselfAs well as completing practice tests, you can improve your mechanical reasoning skills in a more practical way. Try taking mechanical equipment apart to gain a better understanding of how it works, look for opportunities to work with different tools and equipment, and refer to technical user manuals to increase your knowledge.5Work quickly but accurately Make sure you understand how many questions you will have to answer and how long you have to complete the test. These tests are designed to put you under pressure and you may have as little as 30 seconds to answer each question. But remember only a small minority will complete the test; its more important to focus on getting the answers right.6Read the instructions carefullyMake sure that you have understood what you are being asked to do, and double-check your calculations. Each question will only have one correct answer.7Do your researchFind out as much as possible about the assessment before the test, such as which provider the recruiter is using and the format of the test. Employers typically provide this information to candidates on their careers website; if its not available, ask the HR department or other relevant point of contact.8Be competitiveTry to measure your achievements against other users to make sure you stand out from the crowd.

These style of questions assess your ability to problem-solve using numerical data as well as make logical reasoning decisions. The exam comes in two different versions: SHL Verify Interactive (G): 36 minutes with 24 questions SHL General Ability Non-Interactive: 36 minutes with 30 questionsThe two main differences is that the SHL Verify Interactive exam is interactive (with drag and drop features on questions) and the questions become harder when you answer correctly and easier when you answer incorrectly (known as adaptive questioning).SHL numerical reasoning testsSHL numerical reasoning tests require a candidate to solve realistic numerical problems, aligned to the companys role specifications. To pass a numerical reasoning test, you must be able to understand and work with graphical, statistical, and financial data.Example numerical question:What was the average absolute percentage change in the value of the USD vs the CHF from 2020 to 2022 and 2024 to 2025? A) 13 B) 15 C) 21 D) 16 E) 27Solution: Calculate the change in the value of the USD between the two periods:(1.60 - 1.32) 1.32 - 21.21(1.54 - 1.61) 1.61 4.35Average change (21.21 4.35) 2 12.78, so the answer is A).SHL inductive reasoning testsInductive reasoning questions require you to identify similarities and underlying patterns between shapes and figures. For example, you may be presented with a series of shapes and you will have to choose which image will come next, based on reasonable probability.Example inductive question:Complete the sequence: A B C DSolution: The outer circle is turning in an anti-clockwise direction and the inner circle is rotating 90 degrees in a clockwise direction. So B) is correct.SHL deductive reasoning testsDeductive reasoning questions require you to complete scenarios based on incomplete information. These tests assess both your ability to choose the right answer and how quickly you do it.Example deductive question:Question: Who can you infer is most likely to have taken the lemon cake? A) Maggie B) Susan C) MarkSolution: Given what we have learned, it is reasonable to assume that Mark is the culprit. The facts about Maggie and Susan might help in forming a deductive argument, however, in this context they are inconsequential. Marks pattern of behaviour suggests he is guilty. So C) is correct.SHL verbal reasoning testsSHL verbal reasoning tests assess your ability to comprehend passages of text using logical deduction skills. They typically provide a candidate with written information to digest and draw conclusions from. You will have to choose an option between true, false, or cannot say, based on the text.Example verbal question:Statement: Dont just buy art for the sake of it is the message given by most antique experts. A) True B) False C) Cannot TellSolution: True this is the overriding advice of most experts. So A) is correct.SHL mechanical reasoning tests You will most likely encounter mechanical reasoning tests when applying for specialised skilled jobs that require an understanding of mechanical concepts. These SHL style questions evaluate an individuals mechanical and electronic knowledge through a series of multiple-choice answers. Be prepared to brush up on revision topics such as levers, pulleys, tools, gears, electric circuits, and more.Example mechanical question:What force needs to be applied to the lever to lift the weight? A) 18.8kg B) 19.0kg C) 19.2kg D) 19.4kgSolution: The formula to calculate the force required to lift a weight using a lever is:w weightd1 distance from fulcrum to weightf force needed to lift the weightd2 distance from the fulcrum to the point where force is appliedIf we plug what we can see from the diagram into the formula we are left with the following equation:12 x 24 ? x 15288 ? x 15288 15 19.2SHL reading comprehension testsSimilar to verbal reasoning tests, reading comprehension tests take notice of the time it takes a candidate to read and understand a text. The test will present you with a written paragraph related to the job role youre applying for and will ask you multiple-choice questions to determine your level of comprehension skills.Example reading comprehension question:Statement: To try and get your customer to like you more, you are advised to: A) Ask them about their family B) Spend as long as you can dealing with their issue C) Achieve as many of your own goals as you can D) Find something you might have in common with themSolution: Whilst answers A) to C) all seem fairly sensible, only answer D) is provided as an instruction in the final paragraphIt can be useful to find some common ground with your customers. Having this level of interaction can help to humanize the relationship and will endear you to the customer.Being endeared to the customer means they will like you more and finding some common ground is the same as finding something you have in common with them.SHL Verify Calculation TestCalculation tests feature mathematical questions assessing your ability to sum, subtract, divide and multiply numbers quickly and correctly.

Theyre adaptable to the employers specific needs, which makes them ideal to assess both a candidates ability to take on the role and what their talents are best suited for.PTB includes verbal reasoning tests , numerical reasoning tests and clerical checking tests . While the first two are typical of psychometric tests, clerical tests aim to assess a candidates ability to understand and process numbers and correspondence, as well as proofreading, data checking, and handling multiple sources of information and filing them correctly.SHL graduate and managerial testsSHL graduate and managerial exams are used to assess candidates applying for jobs at managerial and graduate levels. Although they comprise the same types of SHL tests weve previously covered, they use business-related verbal and numerical tasks and come in two formats: Verify tests, which are completed online and typically sent via email by the employer. They are unsupervised but usually followed up with a shorter, supervised version at an assessment centre. They often include a numerical and verbal reasoning test, with the addition of an inductive, deductive, andspatial reasoning test. Management and Graduate Item Bank tests, which are supervised and taken at an assessment centre.Verify tests , which are completed online and typically sent via email by the employer.

Designed to assess your skills, competencies, behaviour, personality and motivation, the range of aptitude tests offered by Talent Q is considerable.What is Talent Q?Talent Q tests were first developed in 2006 by Roger Holdsworth, a leading assessor who also co-founded the testing company SHL .He wanted to design a new approach to assessing people; tests that adapted to the candidate taking them to get more insightful results. This innovative approach is one of the reasons Talent Q tests remain so popular worldwide.In 2014, Talent Q was acquired by the Hay Group, and since then the tests have been administered by Korn Ferry so youll see this name used a lot in conjunction with Talent Q tests.Now, Talent Q tests are available in over 40 different languages and used by firms including, RBS and Ford .What makes Talent Q tests different?Firstly, Talent Q tests are whats known as adaptive. This means they automatically adapt to fit the ability of the person taking the test.If the candidate gets a question right, a more complex problem will follow; if they get one wrong, the next question will be slightly easier.The benefit of this for employers is that it ensures candidates are working at their maximum performance level. This in turn allows a more nuanced assessment from an employers point of view.As well as being adaptive, Talent Q tests are also blended. Assessment types can be mixed together to analyse the individual taking it in different ways.Talent Q tests are also more challenging than most comparable tests. Questions are made more complex by the inclusion of lots of irrelevant data or information, as well as more possible answers.All of these tactics are designed to throw people off the scent and make it harder to determine the correct answer.The time in which you have to complete each test is another factor that makes Talent Q challenging, and is one of the many reasons why practising as many tests as you can is so important.Talent Q test categoriesThe different Talent Q tests are designed to cover all aspects of a candidates strengths, weaknesses, skills, motivations and competencies.There are five different Talent Q test categories: Elements Aspects Dimensions Motivations Situational judgement testsElementsPrimarily designed for graduate and managerial recruitment, the Elements tests assess a candidates verbal reasoning , numerical reasoning and logical skills .Youll be asked questions on passages of text, numerical data or the arrangement of various shapes and symbols (depending on whether youre taking the verbal, numerical or logical test). Overall, youre being assessed on how adept you are at spotting errors, patterns and inconsistencies. Each assessment gives candidates a maximum of 15 minutes to work through all of the questions. For the verbal test youll be required to answer 15 questions, and for the logical and numerical tests, 12 questions.Practising these tests beforehand will help you to get faster and more accurate, which is essential as the Elements test is not easy.Here is an example of a typical Elements numerical question. Have a go and see how quickly you can solve the problem:Credit: https:www.trytalentq.comAnswer: You can see above that a basic contract entitles you to 3 hours of free calls per month. Multiply that by 12 months to get 36 hours of free calls per year.AspectsAspects is a competency-based test designed to assess your behaviours, and the character traits youre likely to display in the workplace.Employers tend to use this test at the earlier stages of recruitment, when they want to get a quick and accurate picture of which candidates have the characteristics theyre looking for.The tests only take eight minutes to complete, so its low-time investment for both candidate and employer.There are two different types of Aspects tests: Aspects Ability most commonly used for hiring sales or customer service positions, this test looks at a candidates verbal, numerical and accuracy skills. Aspects Style a questionnaire that assesses your workplace persona against the key competencies needed for success in the role.Here is an example of an Aspects Ability question; take a look to familiarise yourself with the language and format.Credit: https:www.trytalentq.comAnswer: They are the same in rows 2, 3 and 5.DimensionsDimensions is perhaps best summed up as a personality questionnaire .The questionnaire looks at how you like to work, how you manage relationships, how you communicate and how you approach your daily tasks, as well as what motivates you to succeed.Its an indicator of how youre likely to fit into the team and company, how they can engage and retain you, and how they can work with you to maximise your personal and professional success.The way it works is very simple. Youll be presented with a series of statements which youll have to rank from very true to completely untrue, depending on how you feel. This information can then be used to generate all of the following: Trait profile your individual traits. Behaviour at work profile how you prefer to do things at work. Team profile how well youre likely to work as part of a team. Sales profile how adept you are at sales. Role match profile how well your character matches the essential traits of the role youre applying for. Derailment report the potential areas to watch; which parts of your character will be tested in times of stress or pressure? Potential report your potential for leadership based on your individual character.Here is an example of a Dimensions question:Credit: https:www.trytalentq.comMotivations Just as the title suggests, this test looks more closely at an individuals motivations for success, what drives them and what they value most.Getting access to information like this before you hire someone is valuable to an employer. It can help them to tailor elements of the role, ensure the chosen hire gets the best out of their time at the company, and it can do wonders for the success of both the individual and the business as a whole.When you get the questionnaire, youll see a series of statements relating to areas that may motivate someone to work harder to excel at a job. Youll need to rate them from not important to extremely important.It goes without saying that honesty is always the best policy. Just as the employer is looking for the right candidate, its important to remember that you are also looking for the right job and its only in answering the questions truthfully and openly that youll find what youre looking for.Talent Q situational judgement testsTalent Qs situational judgement test is designed to assess how you respond to commonplace work challenges.Youll have to read through a series of different scenarios and select your preferred response from a list of possibilities. How youve elected to respond will then be compared to the requirements of this particular role, to see if youre a good fit.Again, its important to be honest, but its also worth bearing in mind the particular requirements of that role. For example, if its a sales job youre applying for, its likely that an employer will be looking for someone who shows a natural aptitude for customer service and communication.Jump to a section on this page: What is Talent Q?

Such test types include but are not limited to skills, knowledge, abilities, and personality traits.What is a Psychometric Test?A psychometric test is an activity or assessment that is conducted with the purpose of examining individual differences that may impact a candidates suitability for a job role. Designed and developed appropriately, psychometric tests are scientific and objective tools aiming to reduce bias and help organizations compare candidates ability to perform a job role in a fair manner.Employers can utilize the information gathered through psychometric testing to better understand candidates strengths and risk areas and utilize that information during the latter stages of the hiring process, such as in-person or video interviews .SHL's Industry AwardsSHL is an industry leader in the design and development of psychometric tests, positioned to drive improved business results for its clients by providing better intelligence about their people.SHL's Industry AwardsPsychometric Test TypesSkillKnowledge TestsThese assess ones ability to perform specific job-related tasks and duties.

Ability tests measure ones general ability to learn, process information, and solve problems.SHL Cognitive AssessmentPersonality TestsThese assess personal behavioral preferences how an individual likes to work. They are not concerned with abilities, but how an individual sees him or herself in the way they relate to others, their approach to problems, and how they deal with feelings and emotions.SHL Personality AssessmentsSHL's Assessment PortfolioSHL has a large library of psychometric tests, covering skills, knowledge tests, ability, and aptitude tests, as well as personality, behavioral, and competency-based assessments. SHL also has tools and consultants available to help organizations determine the right psychometric test for their talent management need.SHL's Assessment PortfolioCustomers TestimonialsHR Specialist and Project ManagerHead of Organizational DevelopmentSunderland City CouncilManager: Career ServicesUniversity of Stellenbosch Business SchoolFrequently Asked Questions about Psychometric TestsWhat jobs require psychometric testing?Roles from different levels, disciplines, and industries can be selected through psychometric testing because the purpose of this test is to provide measurable data of candidate competency and compatibility.

By delivering engaging experiences built on science through global expert services, SHL provides one platform for all your people answers.Which psychometric test is best?There is no one-size-fits-all psychometric test that is best. There are many psychometric test types available in the market, such as aptitude tests, personality tests, skill-based assessments, and simulations. Organizations should evaluate the use of potential psychometric tests for the purpose in which theyll be applied. It is important to understand the definition of the psychometric test and what it measures, along with the meaning of the score produced by the psychometric test.Professional guidelines (e.g., Principles for the Validation and Use of Personnel Selection Procedures, 2003; Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, 1999; International Guidelines for Testing, 2000) have established key standards to evaluate assessments, whether they are traditional multiple-choice knowledge tests or interactive, gamified judgment assessments. SHL psychometric tests are developed by highly trained measurement specialists to meet and exceed industry best practices.Although there is no simple, formulaic approach for selecting the best assessment, the following criteria should always be evaluated in selecting the assessment tool most appropriate for a need: ReliabilityValidity: Precision and stability of scores and extent to which scores are useful for predicting job-relevant outcomes Adverse Impact: Extent to which members of protected groups (e.g., minorities, women, those over 40) systematically score lower on the assessment than majority group members Cost-Benefit: Relative expense of developing, administering, and maintaining the assessment User Reactions and Perceptions: Extent to which candidates react positively to the assessmentThese four major criteria are critical for ensuring that assessments are producing desirable results, minimizing legal risk, and ensuring a positive candidate experience. All criteria should be considered together when implementing assessments, and evidence supporting each criterion should be available or collected. The potential risks of ignoring this information are significant and may include negative impacts on employer brand, employment decisions based on inaccurate information, or claims of discrimination in a hiring program.How are psychometric tests administered? There are many options and methods to consider when determining how to best conduct a psychometric test. Initially, most psychometric testing was applied through paper-and-pencil assessment materials, delivered in-person by a representative of the hiring organization.  However, over the past two decades, the field of psychometric testing has seen a shift in administration method due to the advent and widespread adoption of the internet. Organizations receive more applications for job opportunities than ever, and as a result, the identification of cost- and time-efficient processes to help determine top candidates for critical positions is of paramount importance.Psychometric testing for pre-employment screening can effectively identify candidates who are well suited to positions, but recent economic conditions have forced organizations to slot testing earlier in the hiring process to help reduce the more time- and resource-intensive phases of hiring. As a result, unproctored Internet testing (UIT) has emerged as a mode of administration that brings multiple advantages to organizations, including decreased time-to-fill and recruitment costs.Does psychometric testing work in recruitment?Psychometric testing is often used within the recruitment process in order to help organizations select the right candidate for a job. Applied correctly, psychometric tests can add substantial value to an organization by ensuring new employees hired for a job have the right aptitude and competency profile for the role. When organizations spend the time and effort to make the right hire, they benefit through reduced turn-over which drives down overall costs that come with training and rehiring due to high levels of attrition.What type of questions are asked in a psychometric test?The types of questions that are asked in a psychometric test vary depending on the psychometric test type and the measurement model that is applied within the test.For example, for a numerical reasoning test, the test question might consist of a table or graph filled with numerical information, a question based on that information, followed by four or five response options from which the candidate would select the right answer. Alternatively, newer and more innovative psychometric tests of numerical reasoning, such as SHLs Verify Interactive suite of cognitive assessments, instead use an interactive format in which candidates are still presented with numeric information but instead of being presented with multiple-choice options from which to select the right answer, the candidate might be asked to drag and drop responses within certain areas of the screen.  By removing the multiple-choice response options, candidates can rely less on guessing or random chance to get the item correct, making these purer measures of a persons ability. Another common psychometric test is a work personality questionnaire . These types of tests are designed to measure individual differences on constructs related to ones work styles and preferences. The questions on these types of tests vary in their presentation. In some work personality questionnaires, a single statement may be presented to the candidate (e.g., I like meeting new people) and the candidate is asked to rate the degree to which they agree with the statement (strongly disagree, disagree, unsure, agree, strongly agree).  These types of personality tests are often considered as transparent and easy to fake.  Alternatively, there are work personality questionnaires such as SHLs Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ) that utilize a forced-choice format. For the Occupational Personality Questionnaire, three equally desirable statements are displayed to the candidate. The candidate selects which of the three statements is most like them. Then from the remaining two statements, they again select which is most like them. This format is more sophisticated than the previously described method and is designed to reduce faking and bias in candidate responses through the lack of transparency on which statement among the three would be considered best.What is a psychometric test example?There are many psychometric test types available in the market, such as aptitude tests, work personality questionnaires, skill-based assessments , and simulations . SHL provides the opportunity to experience psychometric test examples and practice a variety of psychometric test types at our test preparation and career center .How do you pass a psychometric test?The way people are selected for a job varies greatly from one employer to another and depends often on the requirements of the specific job role being hired. Psychometric tests are used to determine strengths and weaknesses and how they align with the requirements of the job. There is no blueprint to ensuring that an individual passes a given test. That said, there are actions that can be taken to optimize the chances of success. Before the test, you should: Make sure you understand what psychometric tests you will be taking and what they will tell the employer about your fit for the job. Prepare yourself using practice tests, if available. Familiarization with the different types of questions and timing of the tests can help you feel more relaxed in the real assessment situation, giving you a better opportunity to show your true ability. If you consider yourself as having a disability, make sure your recruiter is aware of it so he or she can discuss any possible adjustments to the psychometric tests with you. At SHL, our team is committed to supporting candidates with disabilities.During the test, you should: Read through the instructions carefully and complete all practice and example questions. Dont make assumptions about how you should respond. If you try to guess what the assessors are looking for, you may be wrong. It is best to be yourself and respond honestly.What is an OPQ test? SHLs OPQ32 is a psychometric test based on an occupational model of personality, which describes 32 dimensions or scales of peoples preferred or typical style of behaving, thinking, and feeling at work. OPQ32 is designed to be an international model of personality, reflecting the changing nature of work at the beginning of the 21st century.The OPQ32 model follows the general OPQ model of personality, which breaks personality down into three domains: Relationships with People, Thinking Styles, and Feelings, and Emotions. The three domains are joined by a potential fourth the Dynamism domain which is composed of scales such as Vigorous, Achieving, and Competitive that relate to sources of energy. The OPQ model of personality provides OPQ users with a clear framework for interpreting complex patterns of personality.Explore SHLs Wide Range of SolutionsWith our platform of pre-configured talent acquisition and talent management solutions, maximize the potential of your companys greatest assetyour people.

It provides insights into an individual's potential by matching their preferences to role requirements and is backed by science with strong predictive accuracy.Are SHL assessments reliable?SHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes.

They help organizations understand how candidates may perform in specific roles. SHL assessments are scientifically developed tools built on psychometric principles, ensuring they are reliable, valid, and suitable for making informed talent decisions.Why should I use psychometric assessments?Psychometric assessments offer objective and reliable insights into candidates' individual differences such as skills, abilities, personality traits, and potential, enabling organizations to make informed talent decisions.

In practice, AI-inferred data might be combined with psychometric data, but for robust and defensible decision-making, psychometric tools offer greater reliability and value.Are SHL assessments valid?SHL's adherence to legal and scientific standards ensures that its assessments are developed and validated to be fair, reliable, and appropriate for their intended purposes in selection processes.

This is especially true when considering candidates for leadership or roles that are particularly people-centric. Understanding how strong candidates are in terms of resilience, self-belief or even networking means you gain greater confidence in short-listing by validating decisions for these important hires.Frequently asked questions about Emotional IntelligenceHow can I use this assessment in a development conversation?The Thomas Emotional Intelligence assessment results can be used alongside an annual appraisal or performance review process. Discuss which trait scores an individual feels contributed to their successes and achievements. Do any of them pose a challenge for future goals or present an opportunity for growth?Hint: Use the Development Tips in a specific context, such as improving time management or active listening. This will help individuals to implement suggestions more effectively.Will the assessment need to be retaken? You can retake an assessment if you reissue the invitation. However, we would advise against it as we would not expect a significant change. The results should be used as a starting point rather than a way to track development. Any re-take should be 12 months after the original assessment.Do external factors influence the score? E.g. if someone is experiencing something particularly stressful outside of workAs with all psychometric assessments, it's best to complete it when you feel most like your usual self. Intense emotions can skew self-perception, meaning responses may reflect a temporary state rather than your day-to-day reality. Managers and feedback providers should check that the results resonate, and can encourage individuals to reflect on what may have impacted their scoresIs the Emotional Intelligence (EI) assessment a strong predictor of performance?Emotional intelligence helps us understand ourselves and the individuals we associate with by providing insights into how we understand and manage our own emotions and those of others. It also impacts how we may react in certain circumstances (e.g. high-pressure roles or roles that involve the persuasion of others), so it can be a good indicator of whether an individual is well suited to specific situations or roles.It has also been found to be predictive of several important work outcomes: Connection at work: There is a strong positive relationship between Emotional Intelligence and the level of connection individuals feel in the workplace. Turnover intention: Theres a meaningful correlation to employee retention. Self-reported job performance also correlates strongly with:Task performance (success in performing job-related tasks)Contextual performance (engagement in activities beyond core tasks)Counterproductive work behavior (behaviors that disrupt the workplace). High emotional intelligence is also a significant predictor of an individual's being less likely to engage in disruptive behaviors at work.Connection at work: There is a strong positive relationship between Emotional Intelligence and the level of connection individuals feel in the workplace.Turnover intention: Theres a meaningful correlation to employee retention.Self-reported job performance also correlates strongly with: Task performance (success in performing job-related tasks) Contextual performance (engagement in activities beyond core tasks) Counterproductive work behavior (behaviors that disrupt the workplace).Task performance (success in performing job-related tasks)Contextual performance (engagement in activities beyond core tasks)Counterproductive work behavior (behaviors that disrupt the workplace).High emotional intelligence is also a significant predictor of an individual's being less likely to engage in disruptive behaviors at work.How can Emotional Intelligence be used with other Thomas Assess assessments?Users will differ in their needs based on the objective, but the following combinations of assessments will provide well-rounded data for decision making and gauging development needs:Development conversations Emotional Intelligence and Behavior assessments are very effective when used together here. We recommend walking people through their Behavior results in an accessible and positive waythere are no better or worse profiles. Then, follow this by working through the Emotional Intelligence results, which go into more detail. Focus on examples from the individuals experience and how they fit with the results.A development plan would likely focus on Emotional Intelligence results rather than Behavior results. However, using these assessments together maximises the benefits of each (and understanding Behavior results can help to ease people into the process).In-depth development conversationsEmotional Intelligence and Personality assessments will take you further when used together.Personality examines the traits most predictive of individual success, while Emotional Intelligence examines traits important for success in working with other people. Together, these will be good indicators of long-term success in a role or possible suitability for development opportunities.A useful output would likely include development objectives taken from both assessments.Emotional Intelligence is suitable for recruitment when used with our Aptitude assessment.Emotional Intelligence assessments should be used for roles that are likely to require high emotional and fluid intelligence. These are often leadership roles that are highly complex and novelty-based and require extensive work with people. High scores in these assessments indicate high suitability for this role, but Emotional Intelligence should never be the only assessment offered.Let us show how Emotional Intelligence can unlock team success and request a demo todayPlease select which Thomas product you would like to sign in toAre you a candidate?

Page 4: The right HR tools to make annual reviews work in 2026 Central Test The right HR tools to make annual reviews work in 2026At the start of the year, one question deserves to be asked plainly: is the annual performance review still useful or merely tolerated?In many organisations, it remains a box-ticking exercise. Often endured by managers, dreaded by employees, and rarely leveraged to its full potential by HR. And yet, paradoxically, the stakes around assessment, engagement and career projection have never been higher.The issue isnt the annual review itself. Its the tools and the logic still used to run it.In 2026, annual reviews can no longer be a static snapshotThe world of work has changed. Skills evolve faster than job descriptions. Career paths are less linear. Employees no longer expect feedback solely on past results, but a clear view of what lies ahead.Yet many annual reviews still rest on three fragile pillars: the managers memory, sometimes outdated objectives, and an overly subjective discussion.The result? Decisions that lack clarity, frustrated employees, and HR teams struggling to make meaningful use of the data collected during reviews.In 2026, the annual review must evolve. It should no longer be seen as a simple evaluation moment or an additional administrative formality.To make this shift work, organisations need the right tools and a strategy built on three core pillars.1. Measuring motivation to understand what truly drives engagementPerformance alone doesnt tell the whole story. An employee may hit their targets while feeling disengaged, or be highly committed without really being in the right role.Tools that assess professional motivation fundamentally change the managers approach. They help objectify what was previously based on intuition: the need for recognition, the desire for autonomy, ambition, security or purpose.In an annual review, this insight is critical. It prevents misunderstandings, aligns objectives with what genuinely motivates the individual, and turns a potentially defensive conversation into a far more constructive exchange. Discover MOTIVATION , the assessment tool that identifies key motivational drivers and measures satisfaction levels for each. It helps connect what pushes individuals to act with how they actually experience their working environment.2. Broadening perspectives with 360 feedbackAnnual reviews suffer from a structural bias: they often rely on a single viewpoint the managers.Even with the best intentions, that perspective remains partial.360 feedback tools offer a valuable shift. They introduce multiple viewpoints, nuance and real-world context. They allow perceptions to be compared, hidden strengths to emerge, and development areas to surface that rarely appear in a traditional one-to-one.360 feedback is no longer a heavy process reserved for senior leaders. Its now a targeted tool, used at key moments: stepping into a management role, changing responsibilities, or identifying potential. 360 FEEDBACK helps refocus objectives and highlight the true contribution of employees, enabling constructive, tension-free annual reviews.3. Bringing clarity to skills assessmentDiscussing skills without a clear framework is one of the biggest weaknesses of annual reviews. The same terms come up again and again: autonomy, leadership, communication, rigour. But what do they actually mean?Skills assessment tools particularly behavioural ones introduce structure where there was none. They provide a shared language for HR and managers, make discussions more concrete, and, above all, far more actionable.In 2026, these tools are no longer just about assessing. They are about projection: identifying which skills to strengthen, which to leverage, and which to develop in preparation for future mobility or increased responsibility.The goal of annual review tools now goes beyond evaluation. They are forward-looking, supporting career planning and progression by helping to define the skills to consolidate, showcase or acquire. Discover how Key Predict s behavioural analytics help you anticipate the skills to reinforce or develop, and build clear, actionable career progression frameworks.A real shift in perspective: the annual review as the entry point to the HR cycleThe real transformation doesnt come from tools alone, but from how theyre used.More mature organisations no longer see the annual review as an end in itself. They treat it as the starting point of a broader cycle: skills development, internal mobility, engagement and performance.Insights from the review directly feed into: personalised training plans, career path discussions, mobility decisions, retention initiatives.Without this continuity, the annual review remains a costly ritual with limited impact.This years HR roadmapTo truly transform annual reviews, a clear roadmap is essential. Start bypreparing reviews with tools that provide meaningful data: motivation, skills, and multi-source feedback. Then,structure discussions around shared frameworksto ensure fairness and consistency. Next,link review outcomes to concrete HR decisions: training, progression, mobility. Finally,ensure ongoing follow-upso the annual review is no longer a one-off event, but a milestone in a broader journey.The annual review is neither dead nor outdated. It is simply poorly equipped in too many organisations.Your role now is to turn it into a genuine driver of talent management provided youre willing to shift mindset, equip managers intelligently, and put people back at the centre, without sacrificing objectivity.Lucia Mititel Learning ability Recruitment tips Motivation and engagement Success Stories Emotional intelligence HR Trends Reasoning abilities Recruitment tests 360 Feedback Predictive Matching Employee Well-being Personality Assessments Career management Psychosocial risks Pre-recorded video interview Multi-criteria assessment HR Technology Talent Management Skill development Psychometric tests Work Ethics Soft-Skills and Hard-Skills Management LeadershipAugmented HR: recruiting and developing talent in the age of AIImagine a world where every application receives an instant response, every employee benefits from training perfectly tailored to their aspirations, and the recruitment process is free from cognitive bias.How to assess a candidates learning ability?Learning ability is what enables one to learn something new and be able to apply it in the right scenario.Unleash your learning potential with RIASEC!

Doing this manually would take hours or days. Complex jobs like aggregating millions of social media profiles can be done in just hours or days with a scraper. A human would need months!The scale and speed of extraction that web scraping enables is impossible to match manually.2. AutomationOnce configured correctly, web scrapers can run 247 without human oversight to continually collect up-to-date data.You can have a scraper set to run daily, weekly or at whatever interval you need to keep your data fresh.3. Data availabilityMany websites dont allow you to download their data in bulk. Web scraping lets you gather data that you otherwise couldnt access in bulk exports or via APIs.4. Data structuringScrapers extract data already structured and ready for analysis, unlike copying and pasting from websites manually.5. Price and competitive analysisWeb scrapers excel at gathering pricing data, product listings, service offerings and other details from across the web for competitive analysis and market research. As you can see, web scraping solves many data collection needs for both individuals and businesses. The use cases are nearly endless!Is Web Scraping Legal?Many newcomers to web scraping rightly wonder about the legality of these tools.The short answer is that web scraping is perfectly legal in most cases.Thats because web scrapers only automate data that humans could otherwise manually browse and copy themselves and theres nothing illegal about accessing publicly available websites!However, there are some caveats: Most sites prohibit scraping in their Terms of Service (ToS). But ToS arent legally binding. Scraping private, copyrighted or restricted access data is not permitted. Only use scrapers on public sites. Dont excessively scrape sites and risk overloading their servers. Practice good scraping etiquette. Consult an attorney if attempting to scrape highly regulated industries like finance or healthcare.Most sites prohibit scraping in their Terms of Service (ToS). But ToS arent legally binding.Scraping private, copyrighted or restricted access data is not permitted. Only use scrapers on public sites.Dont excessively scrape sites and risk overloading their servers. Practice good scraping etiquette.Consult an attorney if attempting to scrape highly regulated industries like finance or healthcare.If you avoid private sites and data, focus on minimizing server load, and respect robots.txt restrictions, web scraping remains perfectly legal in most jurisdictions.Now lets move on to the fun stuff actually extracting data!Step 1: Get a Web Scraping Service (Apify)There are many tools and libraries for web scraping, but I recommend Apify to get started.Apify is a cloud-based web scraping platform that handles all the complex backend stuff for you: Browser automation Proxy configuration Scalable infrastructure Data storage Built-in integrationsThe main benefits are: Nothing to install or setup Apify runs in the cloud Easy to use Visually configure scrapers in a browser-based editor Generous free plan Lets you scrape up to 1 million pages per month free Pre-made scrapers Tools exist for major sites like Google and AmazonNothing to install or setup Apify runs in the cloudEasy to use Visually configure scrapers in a browser-based editorGenerous free plan Lets you scrape up to 1 million pages per month freePre-made scrapers Tools exist for major sites like Google and AmazonIve used Apify across dozens of professional web scraping projects, and its by far the easiest way for beginners to get started.Lets see it in action!Sign Up for ApifyHead to Apify.com and create a free account. Just enter your email and password no credit card required.Verify your email, and youre ready to start scraping!Step 2: Configure Your First Web ScraperApify has tons of pre-made scrapers, but well build one from scratch to learn the basics.Well extract the top CNN news headlines, which will introduce core scraper configuration concepts you can apply to any site.Create a New Web Scraper In your Apify account, click Create Actor in the left menu. Select Web Scraper and a new scraper will open:This console lets you configure inputs for the scraper.Set the Start URLThe Start URL is the first page the scraper will visit.For CNN headlines, well use https:www.cnn.com . Paste that in:Add Page Function CodeNext, we need to tell the scraper what data to extract from the pages.In the Page Function editor, delete the default code and paste this:This grabs the CNN headline elements and returns their text.Run the ScraperClick Run and the scraper will navigate to CNN, extract the headlines, and display them in the Dataset tab of the console.Thats it! With just a few clicks and lines of code, youve built your first scraper.The same principles apply for extracting data from any site. Lets learn more advanced techniques.Step 3: Export Scraped DataOnce you have extraction working, youll want to export the scraped data for analysis and use in other apps.Apify datasets can be exported in JSON, CSV, Excel, RSS and other structured formats.For example, you could: Save product data to Google Sheets and make pricing charts Export emails to CSV and import to Mailchimp for marketing Download real estate info as JSON to populate your sites listings Turn news headlines into an RSS feed or email digestSave product data to Google Sheets and make pricing chartsExport emails to CSV and import to Mailchimp for marketingDownload real estate info as JSON to populate your sites listingsTurn news headlines into an RSS feed or email digestApify integrates nicely with Zapier, Integromat, or LinkedIns own developer tools for even more possibilities.If you can dream up a way to utilize the data, Apify provides the means to get it out.Advanced Web Scraping TechniquesThe basics above will enable you to scrape almost any standard site. But you may occasionally encounter complex sites that require more advanced techniques.Lets explore some of the more powerful web scraping capabilities:JavaScript RenderingSome sites dynamically render content using JavaScript. Standard scrapers cant run JS, so Apify provides tools like Puppeteer Scraper and Web Scraper that operate real headless Chrome browsers to execute JavaScript and identify hidden page elements.Scraping Behind LoginsWebsites behind logins can be scraped by automating the login process with credentials and then accessing member areas.Infinite Scroll ScrapingSites with infinite scroll (loads more content when you scroll down) require auto-scrolling to access all data. Apify tools can scroll through thousands of items automatically.API ScrapingFor sites that offer developer APIs, scraping those directly is faster than browser automation. Apify provides integrations to easily scrape and parse JSONXML APIs.Visual Web ScrapingApifys Visual CE tool lets you visually select elements to extract data from complex sites with a point-and-click UI no coding needed.Web Automation Beyond just extracting data, Apify enables full web automation by simulating sequences of actions and integrating scraped data across applications.For example, you could build a bot to: Check product pages for price drops Add discounted items to a Google Sheet Email you when prices changeThe possibilities are endless!This just scratches the surface of Apifys advanced functionality.

While they share some similarities, there are important differences between the scope and approach of each one. This article will examine web scraping vs crawling and how the two techniques complement each other.Defining Web Scraping and CrawlingWeb scraping refers to the extraction of specific data from websites. The scope is narrow and targeted. For example, a web scraper may be configured to scrape product titles and prices from an e-commerce website. Scrapers are focused on capturing defined data from specified sites.Web crawling involves a broader, more exploratory indexing of website content. Crawlers explore websites more widely, discovering pages and links to scrape. The focus is on exploring and finding relevant content to extract. Search engines like Google use web crawlers to index websites and discover pages.Key Differences Between Web Scraping and CrawlingWhile scraping and crawling both involve extracting data from websites, their approach and scope differ: Scraping targets specific data Scrapers are configured for particular data types, like product information. The extraction is narrowed to key data points. Crawling is more exploratory Crawlers explore websites more widely, finding new pages and content to scrape. Their focus is discovery of content. Scraping extracts from specified sites Scrapers gather data from defined sites and pages provided. Crawlers can discover and extract data from many unknown sites. Crawling focuses on discovery The emphasis is exploring and finding new content to scrape vs just extracting defined data points.Scraping targets specific data Scrapers are configured for particular data types, like product information.

Crawlers can discover and extract data from many unknown sites.Crawling focuses on discovery The emphasis is exploring and finding new content to scrape vs just extracting defined data points.So in summary, web scraping focuses on extracting specific data from known sites while web crawling incorporates scraping as part of a broader discovery and exploration of website content.Relationship Between Scraping and CrawlingWhile they have different approaches, web scraping and crawling very much complement one another: Most web scraping tools utilize some crawling techniques. For example, an e-commerce scraper may crawl category pages to find products before scraping each item. Web crawlers scrape content as part of their exploratory indexing. Search engine crawlers scrape page titles, text and metadata as they discover new URLs.Most web scraping tools utilize some crawling techniques. For example, an e-commerce scraper may crawl category pages to find products before scraping each item.Web crawlers scrape content as part of their exploratory indexing. Search engine crawlers scrape page titles, text and metadata as they discover new URLs. So scraping supports targeted data extraction while crawling powers wider discovery of pages and links to scrape. Many scraping projects leverage both techniques in combination.Web Scraping vs Crawling ExamplesSome examples help illustrate the different applications of web scraping and crawling: Search engines Search engine crawlers like Googlebot continuously crawl across the web to discover new sites and content. As pages are found, key data like text and metadata is scraped and indexed for searching. Social media monitoring Scraping would extract defined social data like post text and shares. Crawling helps discover new posts and comment threads to scrape. E-commerce sites-Crawling finds product category and subcategory pages. Scraping then extracts details like product titles, descriptions, pricing for each item. News aggregation A crawler finds new news articles and pages to scrape while scraping extracts article headlines, text, images and data.Search engines Search engine crawlers like Googlebot continuously crawl across the web to discover new sites and content.

The two techniques work together to gather both broad and specific website data.ConclusionIn summary, while web scraping and crawling share some common functionality of extracting website data, their scope and focus differ: Web scraping provides targeted extraction of defined data points from specified sites. Web crawling enables a broader discovery-driven exploration across the web to find pages and content to scrape.Web scraping provides targeted extraction of defined data points from specified sites.Web crawling enables a broader discovery-driven exploration across the web to find pages and content to scrape.Scraping and crawling work together scraping to capture key data from pages and crawling to identify new pages with content to extract.

So you built Read More Bypassing Web Scraping Blocks with Node-Unblocker Page 4: What are some BeautifulSoup alternatives for HTML parsing in Python? - Web Scraping Site - WSS As a Python developer, youre probably familiar with BeautifulSoup (aka BS4) the venerable HTMLXML parsing library thats been a staple of Python web scraping for over a decade.But you may not be aware that Beautiful Soup is far from the only option for parsing HTML in Python nowadays. In fact, there are a surprising number of capable BeautifulSoup alternatives that in some cases even surpass BS4 in functionality and performance.In this comprehensive guide, well explore some of the most popular and powerful BeautifulSoup alternatives for HTML scraping and parsing with Python.Why consider BeautifulSoup alternatives?Before diving into the options, you might be wondering why even consider alternatives in the first place?Here are some reasons you may want to look beyond BeautifulSoup for your Python web scraping projects: Better performance Some newer parsers significantly outperform BS4 in benchmarks. Speed is critical when scraping large sites. More features Libraries like lxml provide additional capabilities like XPath support. Better HTML5 parsing BeautifulSoup can occasionally struggle with malformed and modern HTML. Easier APIs Libraries like parsel offer more intuitive, Pythonic APIs. Multi-threading Some alternative parsers allow multi-threaded parsing to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. Standards compliance You may need a parser that follows the HTML spec rigorously. Easier installation BS4 has some C dependencies that can cause install issues, especially on restricted systems like AWS Lambda. Alternatives with pure Python code can deploy easier.Better performance Some newer parsers significantly outperform BS4 in benchmarks.

Alternatives with pure Python code can deploy easier.So while BS4 remains a fine choice, other excellent options are worth your consideration. Lets take a look at some of the best BeautifulSoup alternatives for HTML parsing and web scraping in Python!lxml Fast as LightningOne of the most popular and powerful BeautifulSoup alternatives is lxml . The lxml library provides an extremely fast, feature-rich API for parsing HTML and XML with Python.In benchmarks, lxml consistently outperforms BeautifulSoup by significant margins. Its not uncommon to see 10-100x speed improvements when using lxml for HTML parsing instead of BeautifulSoup.This makes lxml an essential tool for anyone scraping large sites or parsing huge HTML documents. The speed advantages allow you to parse markup much more efficiently and lower costs for heavily threaded scraping.Some key advantages of lxml: Blazing XML and HTML parsing speed Support for very large documents XPath 1.0 support for sophisticated querying CSS selector support similar to BeautifulSoup Easier threading lxml releases the GIL so allows multi-threaded parsing HTML5 parsing supportLets walk through a quick example to see lxml in action:This simple example demonstrates lxmls speed it can parse and query a full Wikipedia page in milliseconds!Some downsides to consider about lxml: Trickier learning curve than BeautifulSoup. XPath querying has a steeper learning curve than CSS selectors. No built-in encoding detection like BS4. No Pythonic object representation of elements like BS4. Manipulation is done through DOM navigation APIs.Still, for most production web scraping, lxml is an essential part of your toolkit. The speed gains allow you to scrape much more data much more efficiently.parsel lxml, simplifiedIf you like what lxml brings to the table but find the API too complex, check out parsel .Parsel provides an easier to use, more Pythonic API by wrapping lxml and providing a selector-based interface for scraping data from HTMLXML.The key advantage of parsel is simplicity and readability . Parsel was designed from the ground up with web scraping in mind, while lxml supports a much broader range of XML parsing functionality.Compared to lxml, parsel offers: Simplified CSS selector expressions Automatic encoding handling Much easier attribute and text extraction APIs More intuitive approach overallFor example, here is how to extract text and attributes using parsel selectors:TheSelector API will be very familiar to anyone coming from BeautifulSoup or jQuery. But you get all the performance benefits of lxml under the hood!Overall parsel is an excellent choice when you want a simple and intuitive scraping interface but dont want to sacrifice the speed or compatibility advantages of lxml.html5lib Standards Compliant ParsingOne of the coolest BeautifulSoup alternatives is html5lib .html5lib is unique because it parses HTML in the exact way a modern web browser does. It approaches the HTML spec rigorously and outputs a document object model that adheres closely to the official W3C DOM specification.Advantages of html5lib include: Faithful and compliant HTML parsing according to HTML5 browser rules Graceful handling of real-world malformed markup Easy installation since its implemented purely in Python Can act as a drop-in replacement for BS4 in most cases Highly customizable and extensibleLets look at basic html5lib usage:We can see html5lib produces a standard DOM object from the document.One downside is html5lib is slower than something like lxml. But its a great choice when you need a parser that can handle even malformed markup in a browser-compliant way.Alternative Python HTML ParsersWhile lxml, parsel and html5lib are among the most capable BeautifulSoup alternatives, there are a few other options: PyQuery jQuery-style DOM manipulation. BeautifulSoup4 The OG BeautifulSoup. Slower but very approachable API. HTMLParser Pythons built-in HTML parser. htmlmin For minifying HTML. MarkupSafe Implements a HTMLXML parser exposing markup as Python objects. These libraries fill different parsing needs. PyQuery for example provides jQuery-esque DOM manipulation. BeautifulSoup4 remains popular due to its simple API.There are also Python bindings for fast HTML parsers like Goose and jfast that leverage other underlying high-speed parsing engines.While not a direct replacement, for basic parsing tasks Pythons built-in HTMLParser can also work.The point is dont limit yourself to just BeautifulSoup. Evaluate your needs against the many available parsing tools.How the parsers compare in benchmarksTo demonstrate the performance differences, lets benchmark some common operations using BeautifulSoup, lxml, html5lib and Pythons HTMLParser.Ive created a simple benchmark script that times various parsers on 3 tasks: Parsing a 3KB Wikipedia HTML page Finding all links Finding specific elementsAnd here are the results on my laptop:As expected, lxml is extremely fast 10x quicker than html5lib on some operations. Surprisingly HTMLParser holds its own for basic parsing but starts to lag when querying elements.These benchmarks on a small document accentuate differences. The gaps would grow even wider on larger HTML documents where lxmls speed really shines.Real-world examplesLets now walk through some real-world examples using these alternative parsers for web scraping tasks:Scraping product listings with lxmlHere well scrape some product listings from an ecommerce site. Lxml makes quick work of extracting any data we need:With lxml we can rapidly parse even large HTML documents and use succinct XPath queries to extract any data we need.Scraping tables with pandas and html5libLets say we need to scrape HTML tables into a pandas DataFrame. Html5lib parses tables reliably:Html5libs adherence to standards ensures the table scraping works consistently even on problematic markup.Scraping text with parselFor text-heavy pages, parsel makes extraction easy:Parsel gives us the simplicity of BeautifulSoup combined with the speed of lxml!Criteria for choosing a HTML parsing libraryWhen evaluating all these BeautifulSoup alternatives, which criteria are most important for your project? Speed If performance is critical, lxml is hard to beat. Correctness For reliable parsing on problematic pages, html5lib shines. Feature set Lxml provides more complete DOM navigation and XPath support. Familiar API BeautifulSoups CSS selectors are easiest to learn. Handling malformed markup Lxml and html5lib handle real-world HTML more robustly. Conformance to standards Html5lib has the strictest adherence to HTML5 browser behavior. Ease of use Parsel and PyQuery offer the simplest scraping APIs.Speed If performance is critical, lxml is hard to beat.Correctness For reliable parsing on problematic pages, html5lib shines.Feature set Lxml provides more complete DOM navigation and XPath support.Familiar API BeautifulSoups CSS selectors are easiest to learn.Handling malformed markup Lxml and html5lib handle real-world HTML more robustly.Conformance to standards Html5lib has the strictest adherence to HTML5 browser behavior.Ease of use Parsel and PyQuery offer the simplest scraping APIs.There is no single best parser for all scenarios. Analyze your specific requirements and use cases to decide whats optimal. Often using a combination of libraries is best for example html5lib to parse and lxml to query. Test different options on sample pages to get a feel for what works well and reliably for your particular web scraping needs.Going parser-less for web scrapingWeve focused on HTML parsing libraries here. But its worth noting there are alternatives to the parsing approach entirely.Its possible to scrape data without an HTML parser using: Regular expressions Regex can be used to pattern match raw HTML and extract data. Brittle but sometimes workable for simple cases. String operations Use Python string methods to find, split, and slice HTML strings. HTTP requests Make requests directly to APIs and scrape API responses. Browser automation Leverage tools like Selenium to scrape rendered JavaScript content. Convert to formats like JSONXML Scrape structured data feeds instead of HTML.These approaches can be useful but typically dont scale or work reliably, especially for complex sites. Generally HTML parsing libraries are recommended for robustness.But if your pages are extremely simple or you need JS rendering, a parser-less approach may suffice.Key TakeawaysWhile Beautiful Soup solves many common HTML parsing needs, alternatives like lxml, parsel and html5lib are worth your consideration: Lxml The gold standard for speed and performance. Ideal for production-scale web scraping. Parsel Simple API for easy scraping. Builds on lxml speed. html5lib Browser-compliant parsing for accuracy and standards adherence. Benchmarks Lxml is up to 100x faster than html5lib on some operations. Criteria Speed vs readability vs correctness. Evaluate tradeoffs for your use case. No parser For simple cases, regexstring operations may work.Lxml The gold standard for speed and performance. Ideal for production-scale web scraping.Parsel Simple API for easy scraping.

Its a common technique used to gather large amounts of data for analysis, machine learning and more. In Python, there are many great libraries that make web scraping easy. One popular option is HTTPX.HTTPX is a powerful and modern HTTP client for Python. It was created by the developers behind Requests and takes a lot of inspiration from Requests, while also adding new functionality like HTTP2 support.In this comprehensive guide, well explore how to effectively scrape websites in Python using HTTPX.Getting Started with HTTPXTo get started, HTTPX can be installed via pip:Alternatively, Poetry can be used:Once installed, HTTPX can be imported and used:This will make a GET request to example.com and print the HTML of the homepage.HTTPX has a simple API and supports all popular HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, etc.Some key features include: HTTP1.1 and HTTP2 support Asynchronous aiohttp-style API Connection pooling and keepalive Proxy support Timeout configuration Cookie persistence Familiar requests-style APINext lets look at some common usage patterns.Making Requests with HTTPXTo make a GET request, the httpx.get() method can be used:Similarly, httpx.post() , httpx.put() , httpx.delete() , etc. can be used for other HTTP verbs.Parameters like headers, cookies, timeout, etc. can be passed in as keyword arguments:The response contains properties like statuscode , headers , text , json() , etc:You can also stream the response incrementally by iterating over the response object.Using an HTTPX ClientFor most scraping tasks, its recommended to use a persistent httpx.Client instance.The client handles things like connection pooling, sessions, cookies, etc. across multiple requests.Here we make multiple requests using the same client, which handles cookie persistence automatically.You can also configure options like headers, proxies, auth, etc. when creating the client:Now lets look at makings requests asynchronously.Asynchronous Requests with HTTPXTo make requests asynchronously in Python, HTTPX provides an AsyncClient :We use async with to initialize the client, await on the request, and automatically close the client afterwards.To scrape multiple URLs concurrently, we can use asyncio.gather() :asyncio.gather() concurrently awaits multiple coroutines and returns results in the order of the awaitables.There are also other options like asyncio.ascompleted() to process them as they complete:Async IO enables concurrently fetching multiple pages at once, which is useful for speeding up scraping.Next lets look at scraping data from HTML and JSON responses.Scraping HTML and JSON ResponsesFor HTML scraping, we can use a parser like Beautiful Soup to extract data:This prints the contents of the Wikipedia pages table of contents.For JSON responses, HTTPX provides a built-in .json() method:The json parameter can also be used to serialize JSON data in requests.Together with a parser, we can build scrapers to extract data from APIs and websites.Handling Issues and Errors While scraping, there are often issues like connection errors, timeouts, ratelimits, etc. that come up.HTTPX provides exceptions and tools to handle them appropriately.TimeoutsTo handle slow responses, you can specify a custom timeout parameter. The default is 5 seconds.If this is exceeded, a httpx.TimeoutException occurs:Longer timeouts may be needed for certain sites or pages.HTTP ErrorsFor HTTP errors like 400, 500 etc. the response.raiseforstatus() method can be used:This will raise an exception on any 4xx or 5xx status code.Retrying RequestsTo add retry logic, external packages like tenacity can be used:Here we retry up to 3 times on any exception. More advanced retry logic can also be defined.Parallel Requests LimitsWhen making many requests in parallel, you may encounter connection limits.The limits parameter can be used to configure options like max connections:Tuning this parameter based on the target site can help avoid limits.By handling these common issues, more resilient scrapers can be built.Scraping Best PracticesHere are some tips for creating effective web scrapers with HTTPX: Use an HTTPX Client Clients provide connection pooling, cookie persistence and other benefits. Scrape Politely Limit request rates to avoid overwhelming servers. Use random delays and throttling. Handle Errors Use tryexcept blocks, status checks, and retries to handle problems. Use Async IO Scrape pages concurrently to improve speed. But limit concurrency to avoid bans. Randomize User Agents Rotate random user agent strings to appear more human. Use Proxies Rotate different proxiesIPs to distribute requests. Cache and Persist Data Save scraped data to filesdatabases to avoid re-scraping.Use an HTTPX Client Clients provide connection pooling, cookie persistence and other benefits.Scrape Politely Limit request rates to avoid overwhelming servers.

The API returns JSON which we can parse.We could extend this scraper to extract data from multiple subreddits, store results in a database, etc.News Article ScraperHere is a simple news scraper that extracts articles from a site:This finds all .article elements, extracts the title and content fields, and prints the articles.Again this could be expanded to scrape additional fields, parse dates, store in a database, etc.Search Results ScraperAnd here is an example scraper for Google search results:This searches Google for a given query, parses the result linkstitles, and prints them out.Again many enhancements could be made like extracting search results counts, additional fields, scraping result pages, detecting captchas, etc.These examples demonstrate common scraping patterns with HTTPX. The same techniques can be applied to build scrapers for many websites and APIs.SummaryTo summarize, HTTPX provides a powerful HTTP client for building Python web scrapers. Here are some key points: HTTPX has a simple, requests-style API for making requests. Async support allows making requests concurrently. Robust error handling with timeouts, retries and status checks. Scrape HTML pages with Beautiful Soup and JSON APIs easily. Persistent clients provide connection pooling, sessions and cookie handling. Advanced techniques like proxies, headers and auth enable sophisticated scrapers. Follow best practices like using throttling, random delays and user-agents.HTTPX has a simple, requests-style API for making requests.Async support allows making requests concurrently.Robust error handling with timeouts, retries and status checks.Scrape HTML pages with Beautiful Soup and JSON APIs easily.Persistent clients provide connection pooling, sessions and cookie handling.Advanced techniques like proxies, headers and auth enable sophisticated scrapers.Follow best practices like using throttling, random delays and user-agents.HTTPX makes it easy to start scraping with Python.

This method is used when they have to process a large amount of information that is difficult to process manually. The web scraper that collects and parses is a parser. You can make it easy to find content for your own resource and get it up and running in a short time.What information can be web scrapingYou can web scraping everything that is available on the site publicly. Most often required: product names and categories; price; main characteristics; images from websites; ads; information sites; collection of contact information; social media (e.g. comments);Web scraping allows you to work with data on any subject.What is web scraping for?We return to why this might be necessary. A large space of action opens up here. The main problem of the modern Internet is unnecessary information that a person cannot organize manually.Analysis of pricing policy. It is convenient to use competitor data to understand the average cost of specific products in the market. However, if there are hundreds and thousands of positions, it is impossible to collect them manually.Follow the changes. The analysis can be carried out regularly, for example, every week, determining which prices are rising on an average Sunday and which innovations are coming from competitors. With the help of web scraping, you can analyze the site, find non-existent pages, copies, missing descriptions, the absence of certain functions or the discrepancy between the data in the remnants of the repository and those shown on the site.Filling in product cards in an online store faster with a web scrapingIf the site is new, manual filling will take enough time, scraping will significantly reduce the time for filling your site. Usually they use parsing from foreign sites, translate the resulting text by an automatic method, then get almost ready-made descriptions.Collecting data using web scrapingGetting potential customer bases. For example, there is an analysis of compiling a list of decision makers in a particular industry and city. To do this, you can use special sites for finding a job with access to the relevant and archived resume.Web scraping stagesThe web scraping downloads the source code of the page from the site. A program script starts working with this code, which breaks the received text into the necessary fields and saves the necessary data.Searching for data on the page is done using regular expressions or xpath for a specific set of characters, which allow you to select only matching parts from the entire array.After receiving the necessary data, they can be saved in the desired CSV or Excel format in the form of a table, or imported into a database.The principle of the program depends on the goals. But schematically it looks like this:The web screper looks for data that matches the parameters on the specified sites or via the Internet.Information is collected and initial systematization is carried out (depth is also determined during installation);The data generates a report in a format that meets the required criteria.Benefits of web scraping technologyThe web scraper works automatically.Parsing saves time on content creation by borrowing it from other sources.Analyze your site by making the necessary improvements;Analyze competing websites, borrow major trends and specific product characteristics.Usually both options work in close relationship with each other. For example, analysis of competitors' price positions, product base, etc. Page 7: Automation - Web Scraping Site - WSS AutomationHow to Generate Optimal OG Images for Social Sharing: The Complete Guide byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 11 min readWhy use Tableau Public and how to refresh dashboards like a pro byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 6 min readHello, lets talk about when to use BPA vs RPA byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 6 min read5 Surprising Online Research Methods and Digital Tools for Academics byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 10 min readThe Evolution and Controversies of CAPTCHAs: An In-Depth Investigation byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 9 min readA Friendly Guide to Importing Data into Google Sheets byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 9 min readCypress vs. Selenium: Choosing the Right Tool for Web Scraping and Automation byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 9 min read11 Best Automated Browser Testing Tools for Developers byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 13 min readPuppeteer vs Selenium: Which is Better for Automation? byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 10 min readHow to Scrape a Website: The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide for Extracting Data byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 12 min readPutting the tech in fintech: RPA How automation is modernizing financial services byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 7 min readUnlocking the Potential of Brave and Playwright for Browser Automation: An In-Depth Practical Guide byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 9 min readTwo time-saving tools to get the best out of Notion byJohn Rooney Beginners Guide to Web Scraping 9 min readHello friend!

AI Trust Score:Generates integrity score based on candidates behavior and activity.What is Online Proctoring?Online proctoring refers to the process of supervising candidates remotely during online assessments to ensure fairness and prevent cheating.Traditionally, human invigilators monitored exams physically. But with Xobins AI-driven proctoring, most of the supervision is automated. This means real-time detection of suspicious behavior, multiple devices, or unauthorized actions without intruding on the candidates privacy.Whether youre an HR leader, recruiter, or educator, Xobins proctoring suite guarantees the security and integrity of every online test.Why Xobins AI Proctoring Stands OutUnlike conventional monitoring tools, Xobins proctoring solution offers a multi-layered security approach. It integrates AI algorithms, real-time analytics, and customizable controls, allowing organizations to create the perfect balance between strict invigilation and candidate comfort.Heres how Xobin helps you conduct cheat-proof assessments with AI-powered precision.Key Xobin AI Proctoring Features that Prevent CheatingQuestion Shuffle and RandomizationEvery test session is unique. Xobin automatically randomizes question order and answer options, making it impossible for candidates to predict or share exact sequences. This eliminates collusion and guarantees fairness across multiple test sessions.CutCopyPaste DisablingTo prevent plagiarism and information sharing, Xobin blocks all cut, copy, and paste operations, including keyboard shortcuts. This ensures that candidates cant copy questions or search for answers externally. Right Click disablingRight-click menus are completely disabled during tests, ensuring candidates cant use browser developer tools, inspect elements or open any unauthorized windows.Keystroke Recording in Coding TestsFor coding assessments , Xobin records every keystroke to identify a candidates unique typing pattern. This allows evaluators to verify code originality and detect any external code import.Webcam RecordingXobins webcam proctoring utilizes the built-in microphone and camera functionalities to capture continuous video or periodic snapshots throughout the test. This ensures monitoring real-time behavior of candidates without interrupting the test experience.Off-Tab Activity TrackingXobins off-tab activity tracking feature monitors test-takers behavior to detect any attempt to navigate away from the assessment window. If a candidate attempts to switch tabs or access other applications during the assessment, the system immediately flags any off-tab activity and they are promptly warned about the violation of exam rules.Persistent disregard for warnings may result in disqualification from the exam.PS: Warnings are given to candidates.Absentee DetectionUsing advanced motion analysis, Xobin detects when a candidate leaves their seat or moves out of frame, alerting proctors immediately. This ensures the candidate remains present and attentive during the assessment.Multi-Device DetectionOur system identifies simultaneous device usage, such as smartphones or secondary monitors. Even partially visible devices are detected and flagged, ensuring no external resources are used during the assessment. This feature ensures the assessment remains device-locked and secure.Multiple Users DetectionThe AI proctoring system identifies if more than one person appears in the camera frame. This feature assists HR teams in verifying that the right candidate is genuinely attempting the assessment without external assistance.Screen Recording Browser Activity MonitoringXobin records the entire screen session, capturing every movement and browser tab opened. All browser tabs, window switches, and navigations are tracked in real time. Any attempt to visit external pages or open new windows is instantly flagged.Eye TrackingUsing advanced eye-tracking technology, Xobin monitors gaze direction to detect if the candidate frequently looks away from the screen, a common indicator of external help. Frequent off-screen gazes trigger real-time alerts for potential misconduct.Audio Recording Real-Time AnalysisThrough microphone access, Xobin captures and analyzes background noise, detecting conversations or other forms of unauthorized help. Every sound event is analyzed in real-time by AI for accurate flagging.Secure Browser (XoLock)Xobin offers a secure browser environment that blocks all external applications, pop-ups, and unauthorized access. It restricts 90 of external app access, creating a closed and distraction-free environment.Real-Time Live ProctoringXobin also offers live human proctoring for added security. Trained proctors oversee small candidate batches, ensuring no suspicious behavior goes unnoticed.Plagiarism DetectionXobin scans codes or subjective answers of candidates to detect plagiarism or duplicate content. Detailed proctoring reports help recruiters identify originality of assessment and candidate integrity.Non-Googleable QuestionsThese are custom-built questions which can not be searched on the web, require critical thinking and personal interpretation to answer the question.AI Trust Score Algorithm At the end of each test, Xobins Trust Score evaluates a candidates overall integrity based on multiple proctoring signals. This helps recruiters instantly identify which candidates took the test honestly and which ones might require review.Why Enterprises Choose Xobin for Secure Online AssessmentsXobins AI proctoring system is trusted by enterprises and fast-scaling startups for its ability to deliver secure, fair, and scalable talent assessments.

It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning, and focused effort. Paul J. Meyer Productivity is being able to do things that you were never able to do before. Franz Kafka Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work. Stephen King If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done. Bruce Lee Where your attention goes, your time goesIdowu Koyenikan Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact that you choose to live--that productive work is the process by which man's consciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit one's purpose, of translating an idea into physical form, of remaking the earth in the image of one's values--that all work is creative work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by a blank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from others--that your work is yours to choose, and the choice is as wide as your mind, that nothing more is possible to you and nothing less is human--that to cheat your way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear-corroded ape on borrowed motions and borrowed time, and to settle down into a job that requires less than your mind's full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another kind of motion: decay--that your work is the process of achieving your values, and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to live--that your body is a machine, but your mind is its driver, and you must drive as far as your mind will take you, with achievement as the goal of your road--that the man who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, that the man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly going to rust, that the man who lets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap, and the man who makes another man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up--that your work is the purpose of your life, and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to stop you, that any value you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or love, can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be travelers going on their own power in the same direction. Ayn Rand Dont think about what can happen in a month. Dont think about what can happen in a year. Just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be.

(A Definition)Video: Life Planning - Four Steps to a Plan a Great FutureBenefits of Life Planning Life planning keeps your priorities in check.As humans, we have several life aspects to think about, including our families, friends, jobs, health, finances, and hobbies. And yet, there are only 24 hours in a day to complete what seems like a never-ending to-do list and make time for all of the important things in our lives. Creating a general life plan can allow you to list yourprioritiesand rank which ones are most important. Of course, as life goes on, priorities often change. Having a flexible and amendable life plan lets us revisit our priorities and focus on those requiring the majority of our attention. Life planning outlines your dreams and goals.Life plans allow us to put ourbig dreamsandgoalson paper rather than just in our heads. When we see our dreams and goals listed in a life plan, they can serve as important reminders of our purpose and why we do the work we do. This may also enable us to make decisions that are in tune with our dreams. Life planning serves as motivation.Motivationebbs and flows. Some days we wake up and feeldeterminedto accomplish a weeks worth of tasks in one afternoon. Other days, we mayprocrastinatefor hours to complete a chore that would take fifteen minutes to complete. Life plans can help motivate us on the days we lack theinspirationto chase our dreams andmanifest a lifethat we love for ourselves.Life Planning 101: Creating a Life Plan Where do you come from? Where are you now? Where do you hope to be in the future? Which aspects of your life are you satisfied with (e.g., family, social relationships, career, finances, recreation, health, etc.)? In which aspects of your life would you like to see improvement? What are your priorities right now? How do you see them changing in the future? Family Career Social Relationships (e.g., friends, community members, neighbors, etc.) Loveand Romance Mental Health Physical Health Financial Security Nutrition and Fitness Personal Growthand Learning Environment Hobbies Recreation and Fun Self-Love Community Involvement andor Civic Engagement Religion andorSpirituality Specific:Specific goals are clear and often focused. For example, if you want to cultivate more intentional time with your partner, a specific goal could be to spend alone time with your partner every week. Measurable:Goals that are measurable have an aspect that you can quantify to see whether you are progressing toward your goal. Perhaps you and your partner decide you want to take 2 hours of your time every Friday for a date night. Attainable:You likely want to ensure that you are capable of accomplishing this goal. This could include making the goal more achievable and listing out what you will do when changes happen or crises arise. Maybe you ask a sibling or parent to take care of your kids every Friday for a couple of hours so you and your partner could go on this date night. Relevant:Relevant goals will be grounded in yourcore valuesand priorities. Lets say you have been feeling disconnected from your partner. If you are seeking more fulfillment in the romance or marriage department, spending more time with your partner may be a relevant goal for you. Time-Bound:Successful SMART goals have deadlines that can help you stay motivated in reaching your goals. Lets assume you have an anniversary trip coming up in a couple of months, and you want to rekindle the romance with your partner before the trip. You may plan to have five date nights until that trip to feel reconnected with your partner.Video: How to Design Your Life PlanLife Planning Tips Keep your life plan readily available.When we see our goals, dreams, and plans repeatedly, we are more likely to keep them in mind whenmaking decisions. Whether you write your life plan on paper or create one online, make sure your plan is visible to you daily (e.g., taped to your bathroom mirror, saved on to your desktop, etc.) This may help you overcomeindecisiveness. Have someone to hold you accountable.Adhering to life plans becomes easier when you allocate someone to check in on your progress. Whether its your partner, a friend, or a therapist, ask someone you trust to gently discuss your goals with you every few days (or weeks or months). Knowing that you have someone to report to or update will help increase your motivation to achieve your goals. Do your best to be flexible.Life may throw you curveballs before you even pick up the bat. When changes arise that may affect your plans, it may help to beadaptableand open about changing your goals, amending your priorities, and revisiting your life plan to adjust it as you see fit.Life Planning Apps Available on: IOS Cost: Free premium edition available Key Features: Create daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly goals; track habits; write notes in a journal Available on: IOS, Android, Online Cost: Free premiumbusiness editions available Key Features: Task management; daily planning and organization Available on: IOS Android Cost: Free or 6year for premium Key Features: Create and write in a journal; add photos for a picture diary Available on: IOS, Android, Online Cost: Free premiumbusiness editions available Key Features: Create tables and databases; take notes; make vision or mood boards; manage projects Available on: IOS Android Cost: Free Key Features: Create vision boards; add goalsdreams; categorize life aspects (e.g., family, finances, etc.)Life Planning Quotes All you need is the plan, the roadmap, and the courage to press on to your destination. - Earl Nightingale Plan for what is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small. - Sun Tzu A goal without a plan is just a wish. - Antoine de Saint-Exupery Dont wait until youre in a crisis to come up with a crisis plan. - Phil McGraw The man who is prepared has his battle half fought. - Miguel De Cervantes Someones sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. - Warren Buffet The most successful people are those who are good at Plan B. - James YorkeLife Planning Reading Materials Designing Your Life: Build a Life that Works for Youby Bill Burnett and Dave Evans Wishcraft: How to Get What You Really Wantby Barbara Sher Live Your Dreamsby Les Brown Write It Down, Make It Happen: Knowing What You Want And Getting Itby Henriette Anna Klauser Oprahs The Life You Want Planner The Designing Your Life Workbook: A Framework for Building a Life You Can Thrive In Design the Life You Love: A Guide to Thinking About Your Life Playfully and with Optimismby Ayse Birsel The Three Boxes of Life and How to Get Out of Them: An Introduction to LifeWork Planningby Richard Nelson Bolles The Bullet Journal the Past, Order the Present, Design the Futureby Ryder Carrol What Color Is Your Parachute?

(A Definition)Action Plan ExamplesAction Plan GoalsHow to Write an Action Plan Task Definition Identify everything that needs to be done. What individual steps need to be accomplished? For example, if you are organizing a surprise birthday party, the list of tasks might include booking a venue, arranging food, inviting guests, and getting the guest of honor to the party. If you are working with a team, this is also where you identify the individual people who are responsible for each task or job. Create action steps What are the steps or subtasks that need to be done for each task? For example, the task of inviting guests to the birthday party might include creating a guest list, finding contact information for each guest, sending out invitations, and following up for RSVPs. Prioritization Assign each task and perhaps each subtask a priority of low, medium, or high. The criteria for assigning a priority are based on how time-sensitive the task is, how complex or time-consuming the task is, and how critical that task is to the overall event. For the surprise party, arranging food will probably be a lower priority than inviting guests: If you dont get the food arranged in time you will probably be able to arrange last-minute alternatives. However, if there are no guests, there will be no party. For this step, it is important not to default to categorizing everything as a high priority. If you find yourself running low on time or resources, you can use yourprioritieslist to decide how to allocate the limited time and resources that you do have. Collaboration Engage all stakeholders and create a communication channel. This may involvecommunicating with peoplewho are not on the team executing the action plan. For example, you will probably need to continually interact with staff at the event venue to keep them informed of guest numbers and outside food vendors amongst other things. Close After your goal has been completed, take the time to congratulate yourself on what you have accomplished and to review what went right and what went wrong. What adjustments can you make to improve things next time?

    "plain_text": "Pages: 10 Page 1: Conscientiousness Psychology Today ConscientiousnessReviewed by Psychology Today StaffConscientiousness is a fundamental personality traitone of the Big Five that reflects the tendency to be responsible, organized, hard-working, goal-directed, and to adhere to norms and rules. Like the other core personality factors, it has multiple facets; conscientiousness comprises self-control, industriousness, responsibility, and reliability.A conscientious person is good at self-regulation and impulse control. This trait influences whether you will set and keep long-range goals , deliberate over choices, behave cautiously or impulsively, and take obligations to others seriously. (The other Big Five personality traits are extraversion , agreeableness , openness , and neuroticism .) Conscientiousness is generally a key ingredient for successin love as well as work. It's also a major predictor of health, well-being, and longevity.Contents Understanding Conscientiousness The Link Between Conscientiousness and SuccessUnderstanding ConscientiousnessConscientious people are proactive in making decisions big and small. For example, the conscientious don't just set goals , they set a timeline for meeting each goal. People with a conscientious personality do well in jobs that require attention to detail, such as surgeons and pilots; and it's no surprise that the conscientious are less likely to wind up behind bars.These people are not impulsive. They are planners and they abide by schedules. They also do not miss bill payments, they take notes, keep their promises, and show up on time. They engage in self-care through exercise, proper sleep, and a healthy diet . They are less likely to engage in risky behaviors like smoking and heavy drinking.One technique is mental contrasting, by which individuals imagine a goal, the path to the goal , and obstacles likely to be encountered along the way. Such a process can help people choose feasible goals and boost their commitment to achieving them. Both nature and nurture affect this personality trait, and people do become more conscientious as they age.Yes. By and large, people behave consistently when the environment is consistent , but the behavior might not translate across domains. The degree of conscientiousness we bring to a task at our job does not predict how conscientious we'll be about bill paying or other personal matters. It is predictive of how conscientious we'll continue to be in work-related endeavors.The conscientiousness among us may well be more empathic toward others. A Chinese study of 471 nurses found that empathy was positively associated with conscientiousness and agreeableness , while it was negatively associated with neuroticism .Studies in behavioral genetics have shown that this trait is about half attributable to genetics, and half to the environment in which someone is raised, or to developmental factors that are not presently understood. Anatomically, the prefrontal cortex, site of all executive function , is critical in managing behavior that reflects conscientiousness.A person can be too diligent and dedicated, which can result in burnout . In physicians, a profession where conscientiousness can be highly useful, the rate of burnout is estimated at about 50 percent. The Link Between Conscientiousness and SuccessConscientious individuals tend to be high achievers in academics and in professional life. On the job, along with high productivity , they garner higher earnings, good relationships, work satisfaction, and achievement. In addition, the conscientious tend to land more leadership positions.Diligent and thorough people will stick to a problem until it is solved. If they fail, they will keep trying. They are not necessarily smarter than anyone else in the room, nor will they execute a task better than others. They will, however, plug away toward a successful resolution.People high in conscientiousness do abide by certain rules of living. They are, for example, more likely to drive at the speed limit and take responsibility for problems that come up. This also applies to relationships and the obligations that come with them.The less conscientious may oversleep, and be late for class or work and avoid tasks that demand action. But being on time is an important trait of the conscientious person. They keep To-Do lists, are usually prepared, attend to tasks without delay, and prefer orderly routine. They are avid note takers and they write first drafts.Research has found that conscientiousness may mean lower blood pressure, lower rates of diabetes and stroke, fewer joint problems, among other health outcomes . In general, the conscientious person maintains self-care to a higher degree and enjoys a longer life, as well.People at the higher end of the conscientious scale may be at risk of perfectionism and workaholism and may fare poorly under conditions of high stress . As mentioned, overly conscientious people are prone to burnout. Those low in conscientiousness may conversely exhibit flexibility and spontaneity.If you feel a greater sense of agency in your life, or that you have control over things that happen, you have an internal locus of control . And the things and situations that happen are directly influenced by your skills, abilities, and actions you have taken. People high in conscientiousness have such an internal locus of control .At their best, nurses deserve not only to be thanked but also to be studied and emulated.At their best, nurses deserve not only to be thanked but also to be studied and emulated.We often view our cravingswhether for drugs, alcohol, food, or approvalas indictments of our character.

This trait could help you succeed.Posted May 22, 2017 Reviewed by Devon Frye Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email What Is Conscientiousness? Take our Conscientiousness Test Find a therapist near meI walked out into the middle of the street without looking both ways, forgot to pay parking tickets, lost debit and credit cards regularly and, when I became self-employed, convinced myself everything would just work out.My Ill just make it mentality may be characteristic of my generation: Some research finds that millennials are more optimistic about our futures than any generation has ever been. Among millennials who say theyre not earning enough, 89 percent think they will in the future, according to Pew Research Center . Yet were still making less on average than our parents ever did.If success isnt falling into your lap, dont give up hope pessimism impairs job performance . But it may be time to prioritize an underrated personality trait: Conscientiousness .Conscientious people live longer , get better grades , commit fewer crimes , earn more ( along with their spouses ), have greater influence , are more likely to lead companies that succeed long-term , are happier at work , and have better marriages .Convinced by the benefits of conscientiousness, I set out to master it. One of my New Years resolutions was finishing, details, polish. In my research, however, I found that conscientiousness is far more than fastidiousness; acting Type A only has a weak correlation with conscientiousness. In the broadest sense, conscientious people have a knack for avoiding the behaviors that will damage their long-term happiness and success.Here are 7 things they dont do:1. They don't buy stuff on a whim. Conscientious people anticipate what they need and the future consequences of what they buy. (Its called a budget.) Conscientious people are less likely to exceed their credit limit, miss a bill payment, or cheat on their taxes. And theyre less likely to make an unplanned purchase under time pressure or be convinced to buy something based on promotions or sales tactics.Next time youre tempted toward an impulsive purchase, raise the stakes on yourself: Ask, Do I want to earn more, have better relationships, and live longer? If the answer is yes, then take a week to think about it. 2. They don't take mental notes. Conscientious people know they wont remember everything. So they plan, decide, and draft on paper . They write down important dates . Highly successful people, like Richard Branson, carry a notebook in their pockets at all times. Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis once told Forbes contributor Kevin Kruse , Writing it down will make you act upon it. If you dont write it down, you will forget it. THAT is a million-dollar lesson they dont teach you in business school! Likewise, Harvard Medical School suggests making daily plans and using reminder tools or apps to keep you on track.Next time you think \"Oh, I need to remember that,\" don't trust yourself: Write it downanywhere. Once, when Richard Branson didn't have his notepad with him, he says, he wrote an idea down on his passport .3. They don't slouch. Conscientious people stand up straight . Their posture is a reflection of their attitude: They care about others perceptions of them, they want to do things the right way, and they have high self-esteem . Because conscientious people do good work, they report high self-efficacy which, in turn, is positively correlated with work performance.How are you showing up in your day-to-day life? Literally, how do you show up to work? To dinner? To your workouts? Research consistently shows that how you act influences how you feel . Bad posture, for example, can make you feel stressed , sad, and afraid. Is that how you want to approach life?4. They don't binge. Conscientious people know that small things add up: Every pound and every minute matters. Not surprisingly, conscientious people have a lower risk of obesity and are more likely to lose weight than those with lower levels of conscientiousness. Less conscientious people watch more television, oversleep , and are more likely to engage in risky health-related behaviors like smoking and heavy drinking. What Is Conscientiousness? Take our Conscientiousness Test Find a therapist near meConscientiousness, on the other hand, is associated with good health for both you and your partner. Jennifer Lodi-Smith, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Vital Longevity , explains, Being conscientious predicts good health because the conscientious individual is actually going to go out and do the things their doctor says they should be doing to stay healthy. Instead of binging on what you know is bad for you, take small, deliberate, scheduled actions to improve your well-being.5. They don't break promises. Conscientious people are dependable . Theyre much less likely than others to back out of, miss, or forget appointments. They rarely show up late . Conscientious people know that succumbing to convenience kills long-term goals , and that good things take time and hard work. Perhaps this is why conscientiousness is linked to honesty and integrity . Not breaking promises requires fully understanding what youre able to commit to. Next time youre tempted to say yes to something, ask yourself, Am I certain Ill be able to keep this promise? Framing even a small yeah, sure as a promise can help you internalize its weight, uphold your commitments, and build trust in your relationships.6. They don't quit. Conscientious people have grit. Theyre more likely to continue solving a problem even after failing and they work extra hard to make sure stuff is done right . They may not execute better than anyone else, but they keep executing more steadily than anyone else. \"Highly conscientious employees do a series of things better than the rest of us,\" explains University of Illinois psychologist Brent Roberts. University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth found that a strong combination of passion and perseverance is, in fact, more important to childrens academic success than a high IQ .Duckworth believes there are four components of grit that we can all cultivate: interest in the subject matter (a desire to understand); the capacity to deliver consistent practice (making something a daily habit); purpose (a conviction that what you do every day is meaningful and beneficial to other people); and hope .7. They don't ignore problems. Conscientious people pick up after their dogs poop. They display high levels of autonomy and perceived internal locus of control ; in other words, they take responsibility for what goes wrong, at work and in life, and they fix it. Unsurprisingly, those with an internal locus of control report higher levels of life satisfaction and perform better at work .Conscientious people pay attention so well that they often anticipate problems before they arise: By being conscientious, people sidestep stress they'd otherwise create for themselves, Drake Baer wrote in Inc. Problems dont solve themselves. Small things become bigger things. Save yourself the headaches by scheduling time in your calendar every week to deal with the little stuff.The Bottom LineAfter all my research on conscientious people, I can sum them up in five words: They know theyre not invincible.For those struggling to adapt to the real world, as I did, embodying this trait could be the key to a successful, happy adulthood. It doesnt have to be a radical transition. I started small; I now make my bed every morning, pick up after myself, and collect home office expense receipts for my taxes. And its not too late to change: Research shows that conscientiousness continues to develop into old age.If you're waiting for your cue, this was it.A version of this post also appears on Forbes.com.Facebook LinkedIn image: GaudiLabShutterstock Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share EmailCaroline Beaton is a freelance journalist based in Denver.

Productivity generally refers to the ability of an individual, team, or organization to work efficiently within that time in order to maximize output.High productivity results from a mix of factors: motivation , personality , natural talent, training or education , environment, support from others, time management , and even luck. Physical elements also play a role in fostering productivity: Exercise, healthy eating, and sufficient sleep can boost efficiency both in the short- and long-term. Some people seem to be natural super-producers; others struggle to become more productive and may look to daily exercises and better habits to help them get things done.An individual's productivity hinges on mental energy and a sense of internal and external motivation. It often emerges naturally from work that they find inherently meaningful or valuable. And while not everything one must do each day can hold deep personal meaning, researchers find that maintaining a focus on a larger long-term goal can help activate the drive and energy to push through more tedious day-to-day tasks.Unfortunately, there are countless ways for productivity to be derailed. For example, it takes time for the brain to disengage from one set of tasks and to commit to another, so switching between many tasks at once will slow overall productivity. Technology poses an endless supply of immediate distractions as well; avoiding them as much as possible should help fuel productivity.On This Page What makes people productive? What motivates people to be productive? Why are some people more productive than others? Are certain personality traits linked to productivity? How do emotions influence productivity? Are some people more prone to procrastinate than others? Are workaholics more productive? Is it ever okay to be unproductive? What do productive people do differently?What makes people productive?There is no magic formula for productivity. But decades of research suggest that some people are better able to execute and be productive than others and that personality , motivation , and emotions all play a key role in how well someone is able to get things done. While some factors that drive productivity, like personality, arent always easy to change, those who feel naturally less productive need not despair. Anyone can take steps to increase their productivity, identify hacks and techniques that work for them, and overcome obstacles to productivity that may be in their path.For specific strategies for improving productivity, see Increasing Productivity. To learn more about productivity hacks, see Productivity Hacks, Systems, and Techniques. To overcome common productivity pitfalls, see Obstacles to Productivity.What motivates people to be productive? In humans, the drive for productivity tends to be motivated by a set of overlapping natural desires. These include a desire to contribute to a group, a desire to be challenged and mentally stimulated, and a desire to fulfill basic needs such as food, shelter, and safety. Such desires could motivate someone to complete a project at work , clean the house, make dinner for loved ones, or engage in any other necessary task.Beyond these basic needs, productive pursuits are also driven by identity and emotions; people may be motivated to complete a difficult project because it will grant social status, for instance, or because they will feel pride afterward. The desire to be perceived by others as a productive persona highly valued trait in many culturesmay also motivate someone to get things done, even if they arent technically necessary for survival.Why are some people more productive than others?Individual differences in personality likely play a major role in how productive someone is able to be. Individuals who are higher in conscientiousness , for example, tend to be more organized, attentive to detail, and goal-directed than those who are lower in the trait, which often translates to higher productivity. Individuals who are better able to delay gratification may also be more productive than those who tend to pursue immediate rewards. External factorssuch as support from others, educational attainment, and the environment can also influence an individual to be more or less productive.To learn more about internal and external barriers to productivity, and how to overcome them, see Obstacles to Productivity.Are certain personality traits linked to productivity?Yes. Conscientiousness , for example, has been linked to higher productivity in both academic and professional settings. Other related personality traits such as self-control have also been theorized to play a role. A recently proposed trait known as planfulness characterized by someones tendency to develop specific plans to reach goalsmay also help someone improve productivity, preliminary evidence suggests.How do emotions influence productivity?Both positive and negative emotions can drive or hinder productivity, though their specific effect may depend on the individual. In general, negative emotions exert a much greater effect on someone's output. Feeling stressed and anxious about an upcoming deadline, for instance, could motivate one person to work diligently to turn it in early; another person may attempt to avoid such negative feelings by putting the project off until the last second.Positive emotions such as happiness have also been shown to influence productivity ; one study, for instance, found that participating in a happiness -boosting intervention increased productivity by approximately 12 percent. However, happiness's effects on productivity are complex. Other data indicates that while workplace happiness has shown marked decreases over the past decade, worker productivity has gone up, suggesting that happiness and productivity do not always go hand in hand.For more on the relationship between emotions and productivity, see Mental Health and Productivity.Are some people more prone to procrastinate than others? Yes. People procrastinate for a number of reasons that are subject to individual differences. A person who struggles with time management , has lower self-control, or is high in perfectionism may be more likely to procrastinate than others. Some researchers also hypothesize that individuals high in both neuroticism and extraversion may be more likely to procrastinate than those who are lower in the two traits, since neurotic extraverts may be prone to experiencing the intense negative emotions that can make procrastination more likely.For common barriers to productivity, see Obstacles to Productivity.Are workaholics more productive?Not necessarily. While someone who works compulsively sometimes called a workaholic may give the appearance of higher productivity, most evidence suggests that it is an illusion. In the long run, those who never stop working tend to work less efficiently and struggle to maintain focus. They also have a significantly higher risk of depression and anxiety , which will likely in turn harm their productivity. 'To learn more about how mental illness negatively affects productivity, see Mental Health and Productivity.Is it ever okay to be unproductive?Absolutely. Humans are not machines, and attempting to maintain constant productivity is a recipe for burnout . Allowing time for rest and idleness does more than recharge the brain and body; it also allows for creative, unstructured thought that can foster breakthroughs. It may even increase productivity in the long run.Many people also find that allowing themselves to be unproductive during periods of personal or societal turmoil is a powerful form of self-care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, many people found themselves coping with sudden anxiety, stress, and grief . Giving themselves the space to be unproductive, at least for a little while , allowed them to reduce their cognitive load and manage complex and painful emotions.For more on the benefits of regular breaks, see Increasing Productivity.What do productive people do differently?Evidence suggests that people who are able to maintain strong levels of productivity tend to engage in certain behaviors. These include: they set clear boundaries between work and life; they say no to new tasks when they are overburdened; they prioritize regular breaks and time off; and they happily collaborate with others in ways that benefit both parties.To learn more about the secrets of the highly productive, see Productivity Hacks, Systems, and Techniques.Working from home might not actually benefit your productivity.Working from home might not actually benefit your productivity.Why do we hit the gym, cut our hair, or overhaul our lives right after emotional stress?

Take our Dementia Test Find a therapist to help with dementiaKey points Traits like optimism and conscientiousness may protect brain health. Purpose can be built through goals, gratitude, and mentoring. A strong sense of purpose may reduce dementia risk by up to 28 percent.When it comes to dementia prevention, the conversation typically focuses on biologymolecules like amyloid, pathways like inflammationand interventions that target this biologydrugs, foods, and exercise. Yet emerging research indicates that certain psychological states may significantly affect our risk for developing diseases and disorders. This work has implications for understanding how we can better protect our brains and why we need to consider the bigger, more comprehensive picture for dementia.Psychological traits and states are often seen as incidental as it relates to biological outcomes. But a growing body of research indicates that we need to rethink the link. For example, a recent publication in Innovation Aging found that higher optimism was linked to an 18 percent lower risk of developing dementia over a multi-year period. Similarly, a 2023 publication in Alzheimers and Dementia found that higher levels of conscientiousness , extraversion , and positive affect were linked with better cognition , while neuroticism and negative affect were predictive of the opposite. Yet perhaps most interesting is an October 2025 paper in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry showing that people reporting more purpose in life had a 28 percent lower risk for developing cognitive impairment, even among those with genetic risk for Alzheimers.In context, many of these variables can feel like theyre simply the product of circumstance. Yet additional research demonstrates that these psychological constructs may be more consciously malleable than you think. For starters, a persons sense of purpose may change rather dramatically on a given day. This appears to be modifiable. As an example, research suggests that setting goals and achieving them is a way to create more of a sense of purpose.Luckily, there are several well-regarded tools available to help each of us to increase and expand our sense of purpose. Some of the top options include: Volunteering is a wonderful way to build purpose in life, with research showing that those who volunteer experience higher levels of purpose (by the way, its also linked tohigher optimism) Look for role models you admire or look up to, and consider opportunities to model aspects of your day in a similar way Participating inspiritualor religious gatherings Become a mentor to share your insights or skills with others Engage in a regular practice of reflection andgratitude Ultimately, its up to each of us to decide how or if we want to take steps to positively alter our psychological constructs. Yet as we look at the growing overlap between conditions like dementia and psychological perspective, an active investment in building a healthier psychological outlook should, at the least, be considered as a part of a holistic approach to brain health.

To that end, heres an overview of our editorial process.Editing Standardsand GuidelinesPsychology Today is the largest media enterprise devoted to the coverage of human behavior and mental health. We are proud to be a trusted source for clinical and scientific information around the world; we hold this content, and its authors, to the highest standards.All expert author content is reviewed, edited and fact-checked for accuracy, objectivity and to ascertain that the author has relevant domain expertise. Reference material is written and edited by staff editors. Reference material such as the Clinical Terms is reviewed by credentialed psychologists (Ph.D.s) or graduate students pursuing doctoral work in the clinical domain.Online articles that discuss scientific, medical or clinical matters are vetted for clarity as well as accuracy. You will see key ideas and information highlighted at the top. We strive to make translational scientific information easily digestible; we know that our content informs important health and wellness decisions made by readers. Expert authors and staff editors weigh the real-world needs and outcomes of readers when writing about psychological and medical information.In some instances, it is important to make clear that there exists scientific consensus on a topic. In other instances, it is important to demonstrate competing ideas and emergent information. We flag these topics where relevant.Each article, whether written by a neuroscientist or an individual with everyday expertise (such as chronicling daily life with a mental health challenge), is read, vetted, and edited by one or more members of our in-house editorial team. The online article is reviewed and edited, indicating that it has passed fact-check standards and is fully accurate, objective, and well-reasoned.The first reviewing editor is named on the piece, denoted by a reviewed badge. The piece will be read by multiple editors over a longer time horizon, often with an eye towards confirming that scientific and clinical information remains up to date. In the interests of clarity and continuity, the name of the first editor to review the post is published, even after the piece undergoes multiple reviews.References are provided in the body of the text or appended as footnotes.Contributors are not permitted to use generative-AI to author their text in whole or in part, nor are they permitted to alter the tone and voice of their copy using AI-generated edits or suggestions.  Prior to the submission of each article for review, authors must certify that they have read our editorial guidelines and that the piece aligns with all guidelines including the use of generative AI.Tools including AI are permitted for research and brainstorming.Content Labeling We invite domain experts to contribute to the site and the magazine both to deliver information objectively and in some cases to offer their own takeaways. If an author primarily offers an opinion, we label the piece as such.We also solicit work from authors with lived experience, including, crucially, in the realm of mental illness. These pieces reflect hard-won experience, and are often written in the first person. Because they do not necessarily reflect formal knowledge of a domain, they are labeled Personal Perspectives. Personal Perspectives are first-person articles on everyday expertise in topic areas such as anxiety, depression, OCD, and numerous others.News content is drawn from primary sources and fact-checked for accuracy and objectivity before it is published in the Newsfeed. In some cases, contributing authors will both report the facts and offer a take that draws on their own domain knowledge. In this instance, an opinion piece is considered newsworthy.The ExpertAuthor CommunityPsychology Today publishes dozens of articles and news items written daily by the expert author community. These authors include distinguished psychologists with expertise in domains such as child and adolescent development, forensics, industrial and organizational, neuroscience, sexology, social work, sports and competition, public policy and many others.

When were late reporting on some news items, they become an escargatoire of news, but they mustve been an ambush of news or they could not have caught us unprepared like that. Some might also split of as a murmuration of news when we cant cite our sources. Any other suggestions?alexz commented on the word newshernesheir commented on the word newsan apocalypse of newsa thundersnow of newsan avalanche of news; news avalanchea flood (tsunami) (stormsurge) ( jkulhlaup) of newsa landslide of news, news landslidea taphocoenose of newsalexz commented on the word newsSearching google for \" of news\" gives world of news, today of news, headlines of news, business of news I think the 1920's radio revolution turned news from a physical thing to something which flows rapidly. I think the top 2 'of news' descriptors in the 20th century are 'flow of news' 'stream of news'Telofy commented on the word news Hehe, alexz is doing it right of course, but a taphocoenose of news is great! (Or taphocoenosis?) Thats what my escargatoire of news turns into when Im asleep and only get to write them up eight hours laterexcept that snails dont really have bones, so its more of a chalk of news.A business of news is also very cute, especially since I work for a company called Ferret Go that does newsy things.jake21 commented on the word newsWarriormouse commented on the word newsOne of my favorite subjects :)upatankar commented on the word newsRe the etymology of 'news' one of my teachers said years ago it was formed from the initial letters of the 4 cardinal directions, North East West South, conveying the meaning 'information from all over'.

Find an Active Birth TeacherUnited KingdomInternational Books Downloads Testimonials United Kingdom International Blog Articles The Active Birth Movement The Active Birth ManifestoWhat is Active Birth?Janet Balaskas, founder of the Active Birth MovementActive Birth is A way to prepare your body and mind to awaken your natural ability to give birth physiologically A celebration of the miraculous unfolding of the hormone driven  processes of pregnancy and birth A philosophy and a global movement thathas empowered women to choose how and where they give birth to their babyfor more than 3 decades A common-sense, evidence-based approach that is supported by midwives and doctors, and supported in NHS hospitals and birth centres in the UK and in many countries worldwide.Active Birth has evolved as our understanding of the intricate process of birth has developed. But three ideas have been present since the beginning: encouraging mothers to use instinctive upright birthing positions; facilitating  natural hormonal responses during labour; and empowering women to make their own choices about their births.ACTIVE BIRTH is not new. It is simply a way of describing how women the world over have always behaved during labour and birth throughout history Janet Balaskas New Active Birth1. Going with GravityIn an active birth, a woman is not confined to a bed. She is free to move during labour, and to give birth spontaneously in a position of her choice, according to natural birth giving instincts. This instinct is strengthened during pregnancy, as a woman learns to trust in her bodys natural ability to give birth. Active Birth preparation, through regular pregnancy yoga classes, and workshops or courses you can attend with your partner, helps you to become more confident. In an Active Birth you will choose your own way to move, and to be still, depending on how you feel and how your labour is progressing. You will instinctively find your own way to make your labour more comfortable, and to help your body to align with gravity during your babys descent through the birth canal. This in turn will send a better blood and oxygen supply to the uterus and baby, making birth easier and helping to prevent complications.2. Releasing your own Birth HormonesWhen you are in labour and giving birth, your body produces an internal cocktail of birthing hormones, including Oxytocin and Endorphins, the love hormones. These regulate the birth process, stimulating the involuntary muscular responses of your uterus. They also promote attachment and lovein other words, bonding between you and your baby. This dual capacity of the birthing hormones to influence muscular and emotional responses simultaneously is Mother Natures blueprint for survival.When you have the freedom to move and can labour in a peaceful and private place where you feel safe, undisturbed and unobserved, you are able to release very high levels of Oxytocin and Endorphins. This makes the birth process faster and easier, as natural relaxants stimulate good reflexive uterine contractions and help you to transcend pain and experience pleasure.Learning how you can optimise this natural production of birth hormones will help you to ensure that birth is efficient and the bonds of love between you and your baby are established from the outset. This primal relationship at the time of birth when you and your baby are transfused with love hormones forms the foundation for your relationship with your child and also babys capacity to love. It is the prototype for all future relationships.Active Birth recognises that the ability to birth is instinctive to all mammals including ourselves. Our body centred approach invites you to awaken this awareness during your pregnancy and develop connection with your instincts through your body memory. As you begin to sense the innate ability to give birth that is common to all women, your confidence will grow. Any fears or anxieties will turn to relaxed and joyful anticipation.3. Your Empowered, Educated ChoiceActive Birth places you at the centre of your pregnancy and labour rather than your birth attendants. By educating you about the physiology of birth, Active Birth gives power and control to you the birthing mother. You will discover that pregnancy is not a medical condition, and that most woman are able to give birth without medical intervention. As a result, you will be confident in making the key decisions about your own birth.This releases the potential for you to give birth physiologically and naturally, and for you and your baby to benefit from the release of hormones that are present in every facet of love (Michel Odent). This is one reason why many parents choose Active Birth and why, even in special circumstances, its always best to stay as close to nature as possible and to restore the physiological connection between mother and baby, so the production of love hormones can continue through holding, breastfeeding and close contact in the weeks and months after birth.Wherever you choose to birth your baby and whatever your antenatal preparation, NCT, HypnoBirthing, Pregnancy Yoga or other Active Birth is fundamental and what you can learn from us is invaluable and empowering.Active Birth Teaching ProgrammeThe programme of Active Birth teaching pioneered by Janet and taught at the Active Birth Centre and in other places by teachers who have trained with her , offers you a comprehensive range of effective and empowering classes and courses to prepare for giving birth and becoming parents. They include pregnancy yoga for Active Birth, antenatal classes , up-to-date inspiration for an easier start to breastfeeding and newborn care , as well as a full range of professional training courses in these methods.The Active Birth StoryPrivate SessionsOn our Blog The Power of Breathing What is the ideal environment for an Active Birth?

A yoga mat A few cushions and a bolster if you have one A folded blanket to kneel on A yoga belt you can use a soft belt or long scarf A 65cm inflated birth ball you can use the seat of a chair or sofa, edge of a bed with cushions as an alternative. Yoga blocks are useful but not essential.How should I set up my room for the class?Find a space where you will not be disturbed, and the lighting and temperature are comfortable. Arrange your mat parallel to the screen if possible, so that you can see the teacher clearly on your device and she can see you when lying down on your left side.

Find an Active Birth TeacherUnited KingdomInternational Books Downloads Testimonials United Kingdom International Blog Articles The Active Birth Movement The Active Birth ManifestoAbout Janet BalaskasJanet Balaskas is the founder of Active Birth. Her innovative ideas have inspired parents and birth professionals worldwide. Obstetricians and midwives have a high regard for her work, and many have adopted her methods. She began her work as a pioneering birth educator and author in the late 1970s and founded the Active Birth Movement in the 1980s and published the Active Birth Manifesto . To this day Janet is a leading voice in the global campaign to transform birthing practices. The core work she does with parents and professionals, is now available online through live streaming.Janets has written many ground-breaking books and has recently published a new film She is the mother of four grown up children and one stepdaughter and has six grandchildren. You can read more about Janets personal journey, her published films and books , her campaign for women to become active birth givers and her Professional Training on this website.The Active Birth Centre was founded by Janet Balaskas in the early 1980s. Her vision was to create a local oasis for pregnant and new mothers and their partners and babies, with a programme of empowering classes and courses.  Her dream was to create a dedicated  centre where the importance of the beginning of life  the primal years, was honoured and took its influence out into the world. Having been a physical centre in North London for four decades,  the Active Birth Centre became an on online forum during the pandemic. This was a revelation for Janet,  which led to the discovery that her work could be accessible more more widely. Janet is skilled in delivery through this medium and inspires a sense of community and contact. Janet is a pioneer. Her innovative ideas have spread throughout the world inspiring parents, birth educators, yoga teachers, midwives and doulas. Obstetricians have a high regard for her work and many who encourage natural childbirth, continue to be enthusiasts and supporters. While she remains a leading voice in the global campaign to transform birthing practices, the core work she still does and loves is offered through live streaming and is accessible to all. She leads classes and courses, and runs training courses in teaching and practising Active Birth for professionals.Janet is a remarkable teacher and has taught across the world.  Her  unstoppable drive to give parents choice in labour and birth, and to provide the guidance and information to enable them  to confidently follow their instincts, has fuelled the global spread of Active Birth.I am sure Im not the only woman to feel completely overwhelmed with gratitude for everything and everyone you have inspired with your work over the decades. Every time I read or heard something that enlightened me or changed the way I felt about birth parenthood for the better, all roads seemed to lead back to you and your innovations. Just a few months ago, I was one of those ridiculously well-educated but utterly-clueless-about-birth 21st-century, 30-something professional women who assumed I would march into hospital demanding an epidural and every single drug going. The couple of months before my son was born saw a complete epiphany take place in me, and its changed me forever, Im sure of it. You played a huge part in that. So thank you from both of us, and from the bottom of my heart.Private SessionsOn our Blog The Power of Breathing What is the ideal environment for an Active Birth?

The company immediately picked up the phone and called the bank to deny access. Unfortunately, the number they dialed put them directly in touch with a threat actor posing as the bank to gain access to their account.Meanwhile, a second threat actor was on the phone with their bank, impersonating a company employee. Working in tandem, the two threat actors manipulated the bank into sending a security code to the company for verification, which they then relayed to each other and successfully added themselves to the bank account to authorize transactions.Over the course of two months, the threat actors initiated five fraudulent wires totaling nearly 500,000 in losses. Thats when the company contacted Coalitions Claims hotline.We began working on the case, but were unable to recover the fraudulent transfers due to the amount of time that had passed. The insureds Funds Transfer Fraud coverage kicked in and covered the full loss amount. After the claim was adjudicated, the company was able to recover a portion of their fraudulently wired funds from the bank and reimbursed that portion of the claim.Coalition brings together active monitoring, incident response, and comprehensive insurance to solve cyber risk.

Instead of sending the money to an investment fund as they intended, the money went straight into a threat actors account. When the union called the Coalition emergency hotline, we set the wheels in motion to hunt down the wire transfer and start a forensic investigation with Coalition Incident Response (CIR).Working closely with U.S. law enforcement, Coalition was able to track the funds to a fraudulent Chinese bank account. After assisting the policyholder with reports for both the FBI and the Hong Kong police department, 5.5M of the funds were frozen, diverted into a secure account, and ultimately seized by U.S. law enforcement. The Unions FTF coverage kicked in for the funds that were not recovered, and the full cost of the forensics investigation was covered under the Policys Breach Response coverage.In just a few days, the Unions 6.4 million loss was reduced to around 500K.Coalition brings together active monitoring, incident response, and comprehensive insurance to solve cyber risk.

Page 5: Manufacturer gets decryption keys and avoids sizable ransom IndustryManufacturingBackground Employees: 500 Coverages: Ransomware, Breach Response, Business InterruptionEmployees: 500Coverages: Ransomware, Breach Response, Business InterruptionA large manufacturer suffered a ransomware attack with a 1.2M demand to provide the decryption key. They reported the incident to Coalition, and we immediately engaged breach counsel and an incident response firm to investigate and respond to the incidentthey selected Coalition Incident Response (CIR). The manufacturer had hoped to restore from backups to get their systems running again, but they didnt have viable backups. Unable to operate without access to their systems, they were projecting losses of 1M per day and were seriously considering paying the ransom that is, until CIR suggested an alternative idea.CIR contacted law enforcement in search of a decryption key for this specific ransomware variant. Fortunately, a decryption key was available and, after testing it in a controlled environment, CIR delivered the key to the manufacturer. Within a day, they decrypted their systems and promptly resumed business.Thanks to Coalitions cooperative effort with law enforcement, the manufacturer successfully avoided a seven-figure ransom payment. Their Breach Response and Business Interruption coverages handled the cost of forensic investigation, notification, breach counsel, data mining, and business interruption.Coalition brings together active monitoring, incident response, and comprehensive insurance to solve cyber risk.

Page 6: Financial advisor recovers 3.5M in stolen funds IndustryFinanceBackground Employees: 50 Coverages: FTF, Breach ResponseEmployees: 50Coverages: FTF, Breach ResponseA financial advisor planned on making a few charitable donations, but a threat actor had another plan for their good deed. Our policyholder attempted to wire two transfers, totaling 3.5M, to their preferred charities. Instead, a threat actor intercepted emails between our insured and charities and diverted the money. The financial advisor called Coalition 11 days after the fraudulent transfers, and we swiftly began to work on recovering the funds.Coalition Claims advised the insured to contact the receiving bank; they informed us they had already done so. Coalition Claims also suggested they move forward with breach counsel and a forensic investigation, but the insured had an in-house IT team and was confident they could determine if their network had been breached.After the insured provided the receiving banks information as soon as possible, we worked with U.S. law enforcement to notify the bank. Coalition Claims also advised the insured to contact their bank to freeze the funds. At this point, Coalition Claims notified the insured that partial recovery was possible and they were ecstatic.Just over a week later, the insured informed Coalition the bank could recover all but 405 of the 3.5M! Due to the recovery, the insured did not need to proceed with filing a funds transfer fraud claim with Coalition. The insureds internal investigation determined the compromise was not on their network, so they did not move forward with breach response. Coalition Claims reassured them it would be available should any new developments arise.Coalition brings together active monitoring, incident response, and comprehensive insurance to solve cyber risk.

    "plain_text": "Pages: 1 Page 1: Personality Traits Noba Personality traits reflect peoples characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Personality traits imply consistency and stabilitysomeone who scores high on a specific trait like Extraversion is expected to be sociable in different situations and over time. Thus, trait psychology rests on the idea that people differ from one another in terms of where they stand on a set of basic trait dimensions that persist over time and across situations. The most widely used system of traits is called the Five-Factor Model. This system includes five broad traits that can be remembered with the acronym OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Each of the major traits from the Big Five can be divided into facets to give a more fine-grained analysis of someone's personality. In addition, some trait theorists argue that there are other traits that cannot be completely captured by the Five-Factor Model. Critics of the trait concept argue that people do not act consistently from one situation to the next and that people are very influenced by situational forces. Thus, one major debate in the field concerns the relative power of peoples traits versus the situations in which they find themselves as predictors of their behavior. Big five Five-Factor Model of personality OCEAN system of traits Person-situation debate Personality Personality traits Social learningLearning Objectives List and describe the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits that comprise the Five-Factor Model of personality. Describe how the facet approach extends broad personality traits. Explain a critique of the personality-trait concept. Describe in what ways personality traits may be manifested in everyday behavior. Describe each of the Big Five personality traits, and the low and high end of the dimension. Give examples of each of the Big Five personality traits, including both a low and high example. Describe how traits and social learning combine to predict your social activities. Describe your theory of how personality traits get refined by social learning.IntroductionWhen we observe people around us, one of the first things that strikes us is how different people are from one another. Some people are very talkative while others are very quiet. Some are active whereas others are couch potatoes. Some worry a lot, others almost never seem anxious. Each time we use one of these words, words like talkative, quiet, active, or anxious, to describe those around us, we are talking about a persons personality the characteristic ways that people differ from one another. Personality psychologists try to describe and understand these differences. Although there are many ways to think about the personalities that people have, Gordon Allport and other personologists claimed that we can best understand the differences between individuals by understanding their personality traits. Personality traits reflect basic dimensions on which people differ ( Matthews, Deary, Whiteman, 2003 ). According to trait psychologists, there are a limited number of these dimensions (dimensions like Extraversion, Conscientiousness, or Agreeableness), and each individual falls somewhere on each dimension, meaning that they could be low, medium, or high on any specific trait.An important feature of personality traits is that they reflect continuous distributions rather than distinct personality types. This means that when personality psychologists talk about Introverts and Extraverts, they are not really talking about two distinct types of people who are completely and qualitatively different from one another. Instead, they are talking about people who score relatively low or relatively high along a continuous distribution. In fact, when personality psychologists measure traits like Extraversion , they typically find that most people score somewhere in the middle, with smaller numbers showing more extreme levels. The figure below shows the distribution of Extraversion scores from a survey of thousands of people. As you can see, most people report being moderately, but not extremely, extraverted, with fewer people reporting very high or very low scores.There are three criteria that are characterize personality traits: (1) consistency, (2) stability, and (3) individual differences. To have a personality trait, individuals must be somewhat consistent across situations in their behaviors related to the trait. For example, if they are talkative at home, they tend also to be talkative at work. Individuals with a trait are also somewhat stable over time in behaviors related to the trait. If they are talkative, for example, at age 30, they will also tend to be talkative at age 40. People differ from one another on behaviors related to the trait. Using speech is not a personality trait and neither is walking on two feetvirtually all individuals do these activities, and there are almost no individual differences. But people differ on how frequently they talk and how active they are, and thus personality traits such as Talkativeness and Activity Level do exist.A challenge of the trait approach was to discover the major traits on which all people differ. Scientists for many decades generated hundreds of new traits, so that it was soon difficult to keep track and make sense of them. For instance, one psychologist might focus on individual differences in friendliness, whereas another might focus on the highly related concept of sociability. Scientists began seeking ways to reduce the number of traits in some systematic way and to discover the basic traits that describe most of the differences between people. The way that Gordon Allport and his colleague Henry Odbert approached this was to search the dictionary for all descriptors of personality ( Allport Odbert, 1936 ). Their approach was guided by the lexical hypothesis , which states that all important personality characteristics should be reflected in the language that we use to describe other people. Therefore, if we want to understand the fundamental ways in which people differ from one another, we can turn to the words that people use to describe one another. So if we want to know what words people use to describe one another, where should we look? Allport and Odbert looked in the most obvious placethe dictionary. Specifically, they took all the personality descriptors that they could find in the dictionary (they started with almost 18,000 words but quickly reduced that list to a more manageable number) and then used statistical techniques to determine which words went together. In other words, if everyone who said that they were friendly also said that they were sociable, then this might mean that personality psychologists would only need a single trait to capture individual differences in these characteristics. Statistical techniques were used to determine whether a small number of dimensions might underlie all of the thousands of words we use to describe people.The Five-Factor Model of PersonalityResearch that used the lexical approach showed that many of the personality descriptors found in the dictionary do indeed overlap. In other words, many of the words that we use to describe people are synonyms. Thus, if we want to know what a person is like, we do not necessarily need to ask how sociable they are, how friendly they are, and how gregarious they are. Instead, because sociable people tend to be friendly and gregarious, we can summarize this personality dimension with a single term. Someone who is sociable, friendly, and gregarious would typically be described as an Extravert. Once we know she is an extravert, we can assume that she is sociable, friendly, and gregarious.Statistical methods (specifically, a technique called factor analysis ) helped to determine whether a small number of dimensions underlie the diversity of words that people like Allport and Odbert identified. The most widely accepted system to emerge from this approach was The Big Five or Five-Factor Model ( Goldberg, 1990 ; McCrae John , 1992; McCrae Costa, 1987 ). The Big Five comprises five major traits shown in the Figure 2 below. A way to remember these five is with the acronym OCEAN (O is for Openness ; C is for Conscientiousness ; E is for Extraversion ; A is for Agreeableness ; N is for Neuroticism ). Figure 3 provides descriptions of people who would score high and low on each of these traits. Scores on the Big Five traits are mostly independent. That means that a persons standing on one trait tells very little about their standing on the other traits of the Big Five. For example, a person can be extremely high in Extraversion and be either high or low on Neuroticism. Similarly, a person can be low in Agreeableness and be either high or low in Conscientiousness. Thus, in the Five-Factor Model, you need five scores to describe most of an individuals personality.In the Appendix to this module, we present a short scale to assess the Five-Factor Model of personality ( Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, Lucas, 2006 ). You can take this test to see where you stand in terms of your Big Five scores. John Johnson has also created a helpful website that has personality scales that can be used and taken by the general public:http:www.personal.psu.eduj5jIPIPipipneo120.htmAfter seeing your scores, you can judge for yourself whether you think such tests are valid.Traits are important and interesting because they describe stable patterns of behavior that persist for long periods of time ( Caspi, Roberts, Shiner, 2005 ). Importantly, these stable patterns can have broad-ranging consequences for many areas of our life ( Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, Goldberg, 2007 ). For instance, think about the factors that determine success in college. If you were asked to guess what factors predict good grades in college, you might guess something like intelligence. This guess would be correct, but we know much more about who is likely to do well. Specifically, personality researchers have also found the personality traits like Conscientiousness play an important role in college and beyond, probably because highly conscientious individuals study hard, get their work done on time, and are less distracted by nonessential activities that take time away from school work. In addition, highly conscientious people are often healthier than people low in conscientiousness because they are more likely to maintain healthy diets, to exercise, and to follow basic safety procedures like wearing seat belts or bicycle helmets. Over the long term, this consistent pattern of behaviors can add up to meaningful differences in health and longevity. Thus, personality traits are not just a useful way to describe people you know; they actually help psychologists predict how good a worker someone will be, how long he or she will live, and the types of jobs and activities the person will enjoy. Thus, there is growing interest in personality psychology among psychologists who work in applied settings, such as health psychology or organizational psychology.Facets of Traits (Subtraits) So how does it feel to be told that your entire personality can be summarized with scores on just five personality traits? Do you think these five scores capture the complexity of your own and others characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors? Most people would probably say no, pointing to some exception in their behavior that goes against the general pattern that others might see. For instance, you may know people who are warm and friendly and find it easy to talk with strangers at a party yet are terrified if they have to perform in front of others or speak to large groups of people. The fact that there are different ways of being extraverted or conscientious shows that there is value in considering lower-level units of personality that are more specific than the Big Five traits. These more specific, lower-level units of personality are often called facets .To give you a sense of what these narrow units are like, Figure 4 shows facets for each of the Big Five traits. It is important to note that although personality researchers generally agree about the value of the Big Five traits as a way to summarize ones personality, there is no widely accepted list of facets that should be studied. The list seen here, based on work by researchers Paul Costa and Jeff McCrae, thus reflects just one possible list among many. It should, however, give you an idea of some of the facets making up each of the Five-Factor Model.Facets can be useful because they provide more specific descriptions of what a person is like. For instance, if we take our friend who loves parties but hates public speaking, we might say that this person scores high on the gregariousness and warmth facets of extraversion, while scoring lower on facets such as assertiveness or excitement-seeking. This precise profile of facet scores not only provides a better description, it might also allow us to better predict how this friend will do in a variety of different jobs (for example, jobs that require public speaking versus jobs that involve one-on-one interactions with customers; Paunonen Ashton, 2001 ). Because different facets within a broad, global trait like extraversion tend to go together (those who are gregarious are often but not always assertive), the broad trait often provides a useful summary of what a person is like. But when we really want to know a person, facet scores add to our knowledge in important ways.Other Traits Beyond the Five-Factor Model Despite the popularity of the Five-Factor Model, it is certainly not the only model that exists. Some suggest that there are more than five major traits, or perhaps even fewer. For example, in one of the first comprehensive models to be proposed, Hans Eysenck suggested that Extraversion and Neuroticism are most important. Eysenck believed that by combining peoples standing on these two major traits, we could account for many of the differences in personality that we see in people ( Eysenck, 1981 ). So for instance, a neurotic introvert would be shy and nervous, while a stable introvert might avoid social situations and prefer solitary activities, but he may do so with a calm, steady attitude and little anxiety or emotion. Interestingly, Eysenck attempted to link these two major dimensions to underlying differences in peoples biology. For instance, he suggested that introverts experienced too much sensory stimulation and arousal, which made them want to seek out quiet settings and less stimulating environments. More recently, Jeffrey Gray suggested that these two broad traits are related to fundamental reward and avoidance systems in the brainextraverts might be motivated to seek reward and thus exhibit assertive, reward-seeking behavior, whereas people high in neuroticism might be motivated to avoid punishment and thus may experience anxiety as a result of their heightened awareness of the threats in the world around them ( Gray, 1981 . This model has since been updated; see Gray McNaughton, 2000 ). These early theories have led to a burgeoning interest in identifying the physiological underpinnings of the individual differences that we observe.Another revision of the Big Five is the HEXACO model of traits ( Ashton Lee, 2007 ). This model is similar to the Big Five, but it posits slightly different versions of some of the traits, and its proponents argue that one important class of individual differences was omitted from the Five-Factor Model. The HEXACO adds Honesty-Humility as a sixth dimension of personality. People high in this trait are sincere, fair, and modest, whereas those low in the trait are manipulative, narcissistic, and self-centered. Thus, trait theorists are agreed that personality traits are important in understanding behavior, but there are still debates on the exact number and composition of the traits that are most important.There are other important traits that are not included in comprehensive models like the Big Five. Although the five factors capture much that is important about personality, researchers have suggested other traits that capture interesting aspects of our behavior. In Figure 5 below we present just a few, out of hundreds, of the other traits that have been studied by personologists.Not all of the above traits are currently popular with scientists, yet each of them has experienced popularity in the past. Although the Five-Factor Model has been the target of more rigorous research than some of the traits above, these additional personality characteristics give a good idea of the wide range of behaviors and attitudes that traits can cover. The Person-Situation Debate and Alternatives to the Trait PerspectiveThe ideas described in this module should probably seem familiar, if not obvious to you. When asked to think about what our friends, enemies, family members, and colleagues are like, some of the first things that come to mind are their personality characteristics. We might think about how warm and helpful our first teacher was, how irresponsible and careless our brother is, or how demanding and insulting our first boss was. Each of these descriptors reflects a personality trait, and most of us generally think that the descriptions that we use for individuals accurately reflect their characteristic pattern of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, or in other words, their personality.But what if this idea were wrong? What if our belief in personality traits were an illusion and people are not consistent from one situation to the next? This was a possibility that shook the foundation of personality psychology in the late 1960s when Walter Mischel published a book called Personality and Assessment ( 1968 ). In this book, Mischel suggested that if one looks closely at peoples behavior across many different situations, the consistency is really not that impressive. In other words, children who cheat on tests at school may steadfastly follow all rules when playing games and may never tell a lie to their parents. In other words, he suggested, there may not be any general trait of honesty that links these seemingly related behaviors. Furthermore, Mischel suggested that observers may believe that broad personality traits like honesty exist, when in fact, this belief is an illusion. The debate that followed the publication of Mischels book was called the person-situation debate because it pitted the power of personality against the power of situational factors as determinants of the behavior that people exhibit. Because of the findings that Mischel emphasized, many psychologists focused on an alternative to the trait perspective. Instead of studying broad, context-free descriptions, like the trait terms weve described so far, Mischel thought that psychologists should focus on peoples distinctive reactions to specific situations. For instance, although there may not be a broad and general trait of honesty, some children may be especially likely to cheat on a test when the risk of being caught is low and the rewards for cheating are high. Others might be motivated by the sense of risk involved in cheating and may do so even when the rewards are not very high. Thus, the behavior itself results from the childs unique evaluation of the risks and rewards present at that moment, along with her evaluation of her abilities and values. Because of this, the same child might act very differently in different situations. Thus, Mischel thought that specific behaviors were driven by the interaction between very specific, psychologically meaningful features of the situation in which people found themselves, the persons unique way of perceiving that situation, and his or her abilities for dealing with it. Mischel and others argued that it was these social-cognitive processes that underlie peoples reactions to specific situations that provide some consistency when situational features are the same. If so, then studying these broad traits might be more fruitful than cataloging and measuring narrow, context-free traits like Extraversion or Neuroticism. In the years after the publication of Mischels ( 1968 ) book, debates raged about whether personality truly exists, and if so, how it should be studied. And, as is often the case, it turns out that a more moderate middle ground than what the situationists proposed could be reached. It is certainly true, as Mischel pointed out, that a persons behavior in one specific situation is not a good guide to how that person will behave in a very different specific situation. Someone who is extremely talkative at one specific party may sometimes be reticent to speak up during class and may even act like a wallflower at a different party. But this does not mean that personality does not exist, nor does it mean that peoples behavior is completely determined by situational factors. Indeed, research conducted after the person-situation debate shows that on average, the effect of the situation is about as large as that of personality traits. However, it is also true that if psychologists assess a broad range of behaviors across many different situations, there are general tendencies that emerge. Personality traits give an indication about how people will act on average, but frequently they are not so good at predicting how a person will act in a specific situation at a certain moment in time. Thus, to best capture broad traits, one must assess aggregate behaviors, averaged over time and across many different types of situations. Most modern personality researchers agree that there is a place for broad personality traits and for the narrower units such as those studied by Walter Mischel.AppendixThe Mini-IPIP Scale( Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, Lucas, 2006 )Instructions: Below are phrases describing peoples behaviors. Please use the rating scale below to describe how accurately each statement describes you. Describe yourself as you generally are now, not as you wish to be in the future. Describe yourself as you honestly see yourself, in relation to other people you know of the same sex as you are, and roughly your same age. Please read each statement carefully, and put a number from 1 to 5 next to it to describe how accurately the statement describes you.2 Moderately inaccurate3 Neither inaccurate nor accurate4 Moderately accurate Am the life of the party (E) Sympathize with others feelings (A) Get chores done right away (C) Have frequent mood swings (N) Have a vivid imagination (O) Dont talk a lot (E) Am not interested in other peoples problems (A) Often forget to put things back in their proper place (C) Am relaxed most of the time (N) Am not interested in abstract ideas (O) Talk to a lot of different people at parties (E) Feel others emotions (A) Like order (C) Get upset easily (N) Have difficulty understanding abstract ideas (O) Keep in the background (E) Am not really interested in others (A) Make a mess of things (C) Seldom feel blue (N) Do not have a good imagination (O)Scoring: The first thing you must do is to reverse the items that are worded in the opposite direction. In order to do this, subtract the number you put for that item from 6. So if you put a 4, for instance, it will become a 2. Cross out the score you put when you took the scale, and put the new number in representing your score subtracted from the number 6.Items to be reversed in this way: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20Next, you need to add up the scores for each of the five OCEAN scales (including the reversed numbers where relevant). Each OCEAN score will be the sum of four items. Place the sum next to each scale below. Openness: Add items 5, 10, 15, 20 Conscientiousness: Add items 3, 8, 13, 18 Extraversion: Add items 1, 6, 11, 16 Agreeableness: Add items 2, 7, 12, 17 Neuroticism: Add items 4, 9,14, 19Compare your scores to the norms below to see where you stand on each scale. If you are low on a trait, it means you are the opposite of the trait label. For example, low on Extraversion is Introversion, low on Openness is Conventional, and low on Agreeableness is Assertive.1920 Extremely High,  1718 Very High,  1416 High,1113 Neither high nor low; in the middle,  810 Low,  67 Very low,   45 Extremely lowOutside ResourcesDiscussion Questions Consider different combinations of the Big Five, such as O (Low), C (High), E (Low), A (High), and N (Low). What would this person be like? Do you know anyone who is like this? Can you select politicians, movie stars, and other famous people and rate them on the Big Five? How do you think learning and inherited personality traits get combined in adult personality? Can you think of instances where people do not act consistentlywhere their personality traits are not good predictors of their behavior? Has your personality changed over time, and in what ways? Can you think of a personality trait not mentioned in this module that describes how people differ from one another?

Your unique approach to life forms a fairly consistent pattern thats recognizable to others. You may have heard someone refer to you as reserved or talkative, perhaps, or say that youre passionate or calm. Theyre describing how they perceive your personalityyour typical demeanor and actions.Personality affects both thinking and behavior. Some people are dutiful, so they take their responsibilities in life seriously, and always show up prepared and on time. Others are more spontaneous and willing to go with the flow. They have a carefree approach to life, but sometimes that involves taking unnecessary risks or neglecting obligations.Personality can also have a significant impact on your social life. You probably know a few people who are stubborn or argumentative, the type you may avoid because they always make you feel like youre walking on eggshells. Then there are people who are just the opposite. Theyre patient, understanding, and eager to helpthe type of people you turn to for support.Think about how your own personality plays into your social relationships. Are you the type of person to strike up a conversation with a stranger? Or do you take a more passive approach to interactions? The answer could have broad implications for your overall well-being.To understand the many different ways personality affects your life, mental health, and relationships, its helpful to know the difference between personality types and personality traits.Personality typesPersonality type models categorize people into different groups based on common behavioral patterns. One popular model lays out four personality types: Type A: highly motivated and organized, but competitive and perfectionistic. Type B: relaxed and flexible, but not as ambitious. Type C: very conscientious, but has difficulty with emotional expression. Type D: pessimistic,anxious, and prone toisolationand distress.Myers-Briggs Personality TypesAnother popular personality type model is the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator (MBTI). It measures how you fall into several different categories: Introversion (I) or extraversion (E) Sensing (S) or intuition (N) Thinking (T) or feeling (F) Judging (J) or perceiving (P)These results combine in multiple ways to form 16 personality types. For example, if youre an ENFJ personality type, you: Tend to be friendly and collaborative. Are creative and like to think about the big picture. Prioritize feelings and values in your decision-making. Prefer to follow a plan and be organized.If youre an ISTP personality type, you: Tend to be reserved and calm. Focus on concrete facts and actions. Prioritize objective information and logic in decision-making. Are flexible and enjoy spontaneity.Speak to a Licensed TherapistBetterHelp is an online therapy service that matches you to licensed, accredited therapists who can help with depression, anxiety, relationships, and more.

Each characteristicsuch as extroversion or agreeablenessexists on a spectrum, and they come together to form a more complete picture of your personality.The Five Factor Model (or Big Five) focuses on five personality traits: Openness to experience.People with high openness are more curious and look for novel experiences. People who are low on openness are more routine-oriented and conventional. Conscientiousness.Highly conscientious people are more organized, self-controlled, and focused on goals. People with low conscientiousness tend to be disorganized, laidback, and unpredictable. Extraversion.Highly extraverted people are outgoing, assertive, and expressive. Introverts are more reserved and private. However, people who are introverts are not necessarilyshy. Agreeableness.People who are highly agreeable are altruistic, trusting, and cooperative. People on the other end of this spectrum are more critical and less trusting of others. Neuroticism.Highly neurotic people are more likely to experience negative emotions and are easily upset. People who have low neuroticism are more emotionally stable and secure.Each of these five factors can be further broken down into more specific facets. For example, aspects of neuroticism include anxiety and self-consciousness, while aspects of agreeableness include modesty and compliance.How your personality developsThere are many different theories on how personality develops. Some of them focus on the importance of early social interactions, environment, and experiences.For example, according to attachment theory , your bonding experience with your primary caregiver during infancy affects your attachment style later in life. This concept can also relate to personality development. For example, if your caregiver made you feel safe and loved, you might be more self-confident and trusting of others. If your caregiver was neglectful, you might be anxious and clingy or withdrawn and untrusting. Read: How Attachment Affects Adult Relationships People other than your primary caregiver can also influence your personality. Peers, friends, family members, and even strangers can shape your outlook and behavior.Social learning theory Social learning theory suggests that youre influenced by your observations of other peoples behavior and how you perceive the consequences of their attitudes and actions. If you see someone successfully use bullying to get their way, for example, you might feel encouraged to imitate their aggressive behavior. However, if you notice the bully being ostracized by his peers, you might decide that aggressive personality traits are punished, not rewarded. Similarly, you may model your behavior after a sibling who uses humor to gain attention and popularity.Even people you only see on television, film, or social media, can also serve as personality role models. You may have adopted the bold but serious traits of a superhero you saw on a TV show as a kid. It all comes down to whether you believe the person youre observing is being rewarded or punished for their behavior.Flexibility of personalityCertain personality traits can seem stable over time. You might have always had a mild temperament, even as a baby, for example, or maybe you have friends who have always been outgoing.However, studies have shown that some aspects of personality can change throughout life. Many people become more trusting later in life, for example. And we also tend to grow more emotionally stable, agreeable, and conscientious with age.Big life events, such as having a child, moving away from home, or forming a serious relationship, can also lead to changes in personality traits. Getting a high-paying job could lead you to be more emotionally stable, for example, while moving to a new city could push you to become more extraverted.The role of nature in personality developmentPersonality isnt completely the result of the way you were raised or what you experienced throughout life. Somewhere between 20 and 60 percent of your temperament may be determined by genetic factors. Studies of identical twins raised in different environments show that both individuals end up with many similar personality traits.Similarly, your genes may put you more at risk of developing certain personality disorders or conditions such as anxiety and depression .How your personality can impact your mental healthYour personality type can have many cascading effects on both your mental and physical health. For example, while most people experience anxiety from time to time, some people experience it more often and more intensely than others. If youre a worrier by nature, youre more likely to fall into a cycle in which anxiety creates further problems, such as insomnia and mood swings.If you have a type A personality, your ambitious traits may encourage you to regularly go to the gym. While this is healthy, if youre too much of a perfectionist, you may overdo the workouts and cause injuries or burnout. With a relaxed, type B personality, on the other hand, youre more likely to disregard your physical health altogether. Specific personality traits can also work in tandem to affect your health. For instance, some researchers refer to the combination of high neuroticism, low extraversion, and low conscientiousness as the vulnerable personality or Misery Triad. People with these three traits tend to be easily stressed , and more likely to socially withdraw or turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms , such as alcohol abuse.On the other hand, a very resilient person might have low neuroticism with high extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. They tend to take things in their stride and can readily turn to loved ones for support. Additionally, a problem-solving approach to life helps them set and meet goals for self-improvement. Read: Surviving Tough Times by Building Resilience Certain traits can also balance out others. Neuroticism might increase your risk of burnout , but if youre also a friendly, ongoing person, you can find the social support you need to weather lifes storms.Concerned that your personality is affecting your well-being?Although some characteristics are more fixed than others, you do have the power to change the way you think and behave. By understanding how specific personality traits can affect your well-being, you can explore ways to find greater balance in your life.Personality trait 1: NeuroticismResearch links high levels of neuroticism with an increased risk of certain mental health issues. If youre highly neuroticmeaning you tend to experience a lot of negative feelings like fear, depression , and anger youre more likely to feel overwhelmed by stressful situations. While another person might take a parking ticket in their stride, for example, you may see it as a catastrophe that ruins your day. Youre also more likely to belittle yourself for minor mistakes that other people simply shrug off.This emotional instability and the tendency to focus on the negative puts you at greater risk for mood disorders such as depression and anxiety , and even psychotic experiences such as delusions and hallucinations.Neuroticism can also affect your relationships. You might feel upset and either withdraw or lash out at those around you for any perceived slights. This can create a downward spiral, as loved ones become frustrated with your negative attitude, leading to rifts in your relationships. As relationships deteriorate, you lose social support and become more vulnerable to stress , anxiety, and depression.Coping with neuroticismThere are a variety of ways to manage neurotic tendencies.Explore stress management practices. Making time for meditation , exercising regularly, and connecting with loved ones are just a few easy ways to manage stress levels . Findings from a 2019 study of young adults suggest that mindfulness training may also be an effective way to reduce neuroticism.Shift from ruminating to active problem-solving. If youre feeling pessimistic about an upcoming exam, for example, plan extra study sessions. If youre feeling insecure about your partner, instead of internalizing your feelings, start an open dialogue . Practice gratitude. When your mind tends to drift towards negative thoughts, it can help to cultivate gratefulness . Keep a daily gratitude journal and write about positive experiences, no matter how small they seem. Consider writing notes of appreciation to loved ones, even if you never send them.2: OpennessApproaching the world with an openness to new experiences can be seen as a positive personality trait, unless that openness crosses over into excessive risk-taking. Acquiring knowledge, meeting new people, and trying out new hobbies are also great ways to keep your brain active and maintain healthy cognitive functioning as you age.People who remain open to new experiences may also benefit from higher social well-being. If youre closed-minded, you might shy away from making new friends , or overlook opportunities to bond with your loved ones in new ways, such as traveling together.Cultivating healthy levels of opennessChallenge yourself to learn a new skill. Try out a new recipe, practice a new language, or learn a new musical instrument. Dont worry about mastering the craft. Focus on experimenting, being creative, and enjoying yourself.Mix it up. If you tend to stick to a rigid daily schedule, leave room for small changes. Take an unfamiliar route to work, or invite a friend to a new restaurant for lunch.Weigh the risks. If youre already a naturally curious person, remember the importance of looking before you leap. For example, some research connects high openness with illicit drug use . As you seek out and enjoy novel experiences, consider the physical, mental, and legal consequences of your actions.3: ExtraversionBeing a social butterfly can come with many benefits. If youre an extravert, you likely have higher self-esteem, find it easier to adapt to lifes changes, and enjoy a greater overall sense of well-being. Part of this may be because extraverts often have more social support and are more likely to seek help from others.Theres nothing wrong with being an introvert, though. In fact, introverts are often considered more introspective, empathetic , and better listeners. Additionally, both extraverts and introverts can suffer from conditions like social anxiety and depression, although the latter may be harder to notice in outgoing individuals.Still, its important to recognize that too much solitude can leave you more vulnerable to loneliness and mental health problems. Staying silent on your needs can also make it hard for loved ones to know how to help you.Finding balanceIf youre an extravert: Be sure to surround yourself with people who reflect your values. You might feel pressure to engage in unhealthy behavior, such as heavy drinking, in order to stay social . Check-in with yourself internally. Spend a little time alone, journaling , meditating , or going for walks. Take time to be reflective and cultivate self-awareness. This is especially important when youre feeling isolated and unable to confide in others. If youre an introvert: When youre feeling down, try behaving like an extravert, even just for a short period of time, to help boost your mood and self-esteem. Start a conversation with a stranger, be proactive in reaching out to friends. Dont burn yourself out though. Recognize when youre feeling socially fatigued and need alone time.4: AgreeablenessAs with extraversion, people with high agreeableness tend to enjoy a greater sense of social well-being. If youre agreeable, friends may gravitate toward your generous and trusting personality. Those very friends form a social support network that helps you navigate lifes challenges and better cope with stress.Research from 2022 connects agreeableness with general life success. Cooperative people tend to be more tolerant of others shortcomings and feel motivated to nurture positive relationships. Its a useful trait to build on, whether you need to improve a romantic relationship or get on better with coworkers.Of course, an affable nature can come with its downsides. To avoid conflict, you might not stand up for yourself during disagreements, or hold back on voicing an opinion that could ruffle feathers.Finding healthy levels of agreeablenessAim to balance your desire for harmony with a healthy level of assertiveness.Practice empathy. Some people seem naturally more empathic than others. However, empathy is like a muscle that can be strengthened by developing listening skills, becoming more aware of body language , and allowing yourself to be more vulnerable. Read: Empathy: How to Feel and Respond to the Emotions of Others Practice setting boundaries and being assertive. If youre too agreeable, some people may take advantage of you. Learning to assert boundaries is important, but remember that assertiveness isnt about being rude to others. You can be direct about what you want while still being respectful.5: ConscientiousnessThe more conscientious you are, the more likely you are to take a responsible approach to life. This can have implications for mental and physical health, as well as overall success. Youre more likely to take your physical health seriously, by regularly exercising and seeing your doctor. And youre likely a diligent employee or student, with an achievement-oriented mindset.Research links higher levels of conscientiousness with better health, including a reduced risk of conditions like heart disease and Alzheimers . Perhaps unsurprisingly, people who are self-disciplined tend to live longer.If you have high conscientiousness, youre also more likely to cope with stress by problem-solving and challenging negative thought patterns.If you have lower conscientiousness, theres more chance youll neglect your health, make impulsive decisions, or pick up risky habits, such as substance abuse , which can impact both your physical and mental health.Increasing conscientiousnessFocus on one thing at a time. Put your phone on silent and turn off the TV when youre reading, studying, or talking to others. This allows you to be present and handle whatever youre doing with more care. Use tools to organize your day and set goals. Use daily planners and calendars to stay on top of responsibilities like bill payments or work meetings. To avoid procrastination and stay focused, try setting a 40-minute timer before a study or work session. When the timer goes off, set a new timer to give yourself a 10-minute break.Slow down to tame impulsiveness. See an expensive item you want to buy? Or feel unsure about ordering another drink in the bar? Rather than feel rushed to act, delay your decision. Weigh your other options and give yourself time to reflect on the consequences.Distinguishing conscientiousness from perfectionismAlthough being organized, ambitious, and self-controlled are generally positive traits, its possible to go to an extreme. While conscientious people desire success, perfectionists are motivated by fear of failure. People who are perfectionists set unrealistic expectations for themselves and others. And because their goals are unattainable, they may struggle with depression and anxiety.To curb perfectionism:Allow room for imperfections and failure. Expose yourself to activities that youre not good at. Play games with friends even if you know youll lose. Sketch or paint, even if you dont have an eye for details. Learn to find lessons within failures.Ask yourself if a goal is reasonable. Aiming to learn a new language within days? Hoping to see workout results within a week? Try to recognize unrealistic goals, be patient with yourself, and acknowledge your limitations.Focus on the bigger picture. If you missed a deadline at work, for example, or didnt score the highest grade on an exam, ask yourself how much these perceived failures will matter in the long run. Sometimes, its more important to learn from a mistake.Remember to celebrate your successes. Theres always room for improvement, but dont forget to acknowledge progress and victories. Even if you didnt come in first place during that 5K, you can still be proud of your effort.Personality and personality disordersPersonality disorders involve unhealthy ways of acting, thinking, and feeling. People with personality disorders often struggle with extreme personality traits, such as intense mistrust, lack of empathy, poor self-control, or social avoidance. In each case, these personality traits can impact your well-being and relationships.Emotional instability. High neuroticism is associated with personality disorders that involve impulsive behavior, intense negative emotions, and difficulty maintaining relationships with others. These include paranoid , antisocial, and borderline personality disorders.Conscientiousness. Some researchers consider obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) an unhealthy variation of conscientiousness, where you obsess about order, tidiness, and perfection. Similarly, having low conscientiousness, unpredictability, and impulsiveness are associated with antisocial and borderline personality disorders .Empathy and agreeableness. Low agreeableness involves a great mistrust of others, so its linked with paranoid personality disorder. However, people with conditions like narcissistic and antisocial personality disorders also tend to be less cooperative and compassionate towards others. Conversely, high agreeableness can be a trait in people with dependent personality disorder. Sociability. People with histrionic personality disorder have a constant desire for attention, so are often outgoing. Grandiose narcissists can appear highly assertive and socially confident, while avoidant and schizoid personality disorders are characterized by more reclusive habits.Personality testsPersonality tests can be a fun way to get to know yourself or your loved ones. Sometimes theyre used in workplace settings as screening tools or to assess the strengths and weaknesses of employees. As well as the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Big Five Personality Test, other popular assessments include:The Eysenck Personality Inventory. This focuses on three core personality traits: extraversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism.The HEXACO Personality Inventory assesses six personality dimensions: honestyhumility, emotionality, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience.The DiSC personality test lets you discover which of the four behavioral styles you lean toward most: dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness.The 16 Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) measures a wide range of traits from warmth, reasoning, and emotional stability to dominance, liveliness, and perfectionism.Taking a personality testWhen taking any of these tests, its important to remember that human personalities are complex and personality tests may not be able to capture the sheer diversity of characteristics. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Consider taking the same test multiple times. Are the results inconsistent? If not, the test may be unreliable. You can also ask someone you know if the results seem to match their perception of you.Take different types of tests. If two tests claim to measure emotional stability, for example, but return wildly different results, one of them may not be measuring what it claims. Taking different tests may give you a greater insight.Be honest and self-aware. Many tests require you to self-report. You can skew the results by answering in a way that doesnt truly reflect your thoughts or behavior.Personality tests are not perfect tools, and you shouldnt take their results as the absolute truth. However, they can sometimes help you reflect on the complexities of personality and perhaps even gain a better understanding of yourself or others.More Information APA Dictionary of Psychology.

Page 4: HelpGuide's Story - HelpGuide.org HelpGuides StoryHelpGuide is dedicated to Morgan Leslie Segal, who died by suicide in 1996 at the age of 29. Described as a rare and beautiful soul, a rising talented writer, and a young woman with great intelligence and sensitivity, Morgan nevertheless grappled with a condition that started as low self-esteem and worsened into major depression. Six years of therapy and a variety of drug prescriptions did not help her.Following Morgans death, her parents Robert and Jeanne Segal began sharing their grief and discovered that all too many others had experienced similar struggles.The pain was so evident, said Robert, the subject so frightening, hidden, and loaded with stigma, that they dont know where to turn.They concluded that the best way to honor the memory of their daughter was by helping people in similar trouble by guiding them toward appropriate information and care.And so HelpGuide was born.The site was launched in 1999 by Robert and Jeanne Segal, Monika White, and the Rotary Club of Santa Monica.In the ensuing 20 years, HelpGuide has grown from a small local project to an internationally recognized mental health and wellness website reaching millions each month. Our mission has remained the same: to provide empowering, evidence-based information that you can use to help yourself and your loved ones.We firmly believe that no matter what youre going through, no matter how bad you feel there is always hope. You are not powerless in the face of mental illness and other life challenges. Our goal is to be a trusted resource you can turn to whenever you need guidance and support.After Morgans death, Robert and Jeanne found her laptop computer containing a collection of her stories and poems. This led to the publication of Morgans Voice.. . . She wrote whimsy as well as she wrote tense and somber drama, reflecting elements of herself, as a writer must, in such a way as to reveal both the light and the shadows that alternately brightened and darkened her soul. In this wonderful book her genius emerges in careful stages and we are at one with a soaring talent which, like a bird in flight, fell too soon to the earth below. Al Martinez, Columnist, Los Angeles TimesOneThe wind snaps at my cheeks as I walk from my car. A young woman sleeps on a bench, her hair, long and knotted, spilling onto the sidewalk, The ends, split and forked, forming a tributary two rivers that lead to nowhere.A bus casts a shadow over her her features disappear into the darkness. I walk past her Telling myself that I am different. My hand trails the railing of the doctors office, the paint is worn and chipped; How long have I been coming here? At the top of the steps I catch my reflection in the glass I look away, into the room, at a painting a sea-scape, waves tumbling and crashing, break-tides overflowing onto the shore.The door to the second room opens, the doctor ushers me in. I sit and stare at my knees, thin and bony I dont have anything to say.The doctors eyes look through me I think of the woman lying on the bench her pupils constricting in the sun I tell the doctor that I am no different. Bands of sunlight filter through the blinds, the doctor says we are all the same.I think of a meadow of sunflowers their necks arching in the wind. I touch a strand of my hair the end breaks off onto my palm, Splinters. The woman on the bench is gone.

The MCQs were generated by the subject specialists, vetted at departmental and central levels and were analyzed in terms of its reliability, validity and difficulty with dis-criminating indices. For reliability in terms of internal consistency Cronbachs alpha was used and was 0.72. Difficulty and discriminating indices for the MCQs were collected from the computer generated marking sheets.Result: The MCQs showed satisfactory levels of reli-ability and validity and majority of the MCQs were within the acceptable level of difficulty index.  A well-structured and strict central vetting process ensures an acceptable standard MCQs.Conclusion: MCQ testing, the most efficient form of written assessment is both reliable and valid. Such tes-ting of cognitive knowledge predicts and correlates well with overall competence and performance. MCQ fairness is an increasingly important strategic con-cept to improve their validity.Downloads PDFHow to Cite ACM ACS APA ABNT Chicago Harvard IEEE MLA Turabian Vancouver EndnoteZoteroMendeley (RIS) BibTeXIssueSectionLicenseThis is an open-access journal and all the published articles items are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

Letter of authorship attached.Author GuidelinesINTRODUCTIONThe new Editorial Board of Annals of King Edward Medical University during its meeting held on 12.12.2015 decided to follow the Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to Biomedical Journals: writing Editing for Biomedical Publications by  International Committee of Medical Journal Editors. A brief account of minimum requirements is given below for assisting the authors, reviewers and editors, the full text can be read at, ( www.icmje.org ). Moreover plagiarism policy of ICMJE, Higher Education Commission and PMDC will be observed. It is authors responsibility to apprise them of plagiarism in any form including paraphrasing and self plagiarism. The Plagiarism Standing Committee of King Edward Medical University would deal with cases of plagiarism and comprise of staff members, and editors. Those claiming intellectual idea or data theft of an article must provide documentary proof in their claim otherwise their case will be sent for disciplinary action.GENERAL PRINCIPLES Title PageTitle PageThe title page should carry the following information: The title of the article. Concise titles are easier to read than long, convoluted ones. Authors should include all information in the title that will make electronic retrieval of the article both sensitive and specific. Authors names and Title of the Program. The names and other relevant information should be on title page only to ensure blind peer review of research article. The name of the department(s) and institution(s) to which the work should be attributed. Disclaimers, if any. Corresponding authors. The name, mailing address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address of the author responsible for correspondence about the manuscript. The name and address of the Supervisor Co-Supervisor (s) Source(s) of support in the form of grants, equipment, drugs, or all of these. Word counts. A word count for the text only (excluding abstract, acknowledgments, figure legends, and references). A separate word count for the Abstract is also useful for the same reason. The number of figures and tables. Conflict of Interest Notification Page Conflict of Interest Notification PageConflict of Interest Notification Page To prevent the information on potential conflict of interest for authors from being overlooked or misplaced, it is necessary for that information to be part of the manuscript. It should therefore also be included on a separate page or pages immediately following the title page. Abstract and Key WordsAbstract and Key WordsAn abstract (requirements for length and structured format vary by journal) should follow the title page. The abstract should provide the context or background for the study and should state the studys purposes, basic procedures (selection of study subjects or laboratory animals, observational and analytical methods), main findings (giving specific effect sizes and their statistical significance, if possible), and principal conclusions. It should emphasize new and important aspects of the study or observations.Authors are requested to provide, and identify as such, 3 to 10 key words or short phrases that capture the main topics of the article. These will assist indexers in cross-indexing the article and may be published with the abstract. Terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) list of Index Medicus should be used. IntroductionIntroductionProvide a context or background for the study (i.e., the nature of the problem and its significance). State the specific purpose or research objective of, or hypothesis tested by, the study or observation; the research objective is often more sharply focused when stated as a question. Both the main and secondary objectives should be made clear, and any pre-specified subgroup analyses should be described. Give only strictly pertinent references and do not include data or conclusions from the work being reported. Material and MethodsMaterial and MethodsThe Methods section should include only information that was available at the time the plan or protocol for the study was written; all information obtained during the conduct of the study belongs in the Results section.(a)  Selection and Description of ParticipantsDescribe your selection of the observational or experimental participants (patients or laboratory animals, including controls) clearly, including eligibility and exclusion criteria and a description of the source population. The guiding principle should be clarity about how and why a study was done in a particular way. When authors use variables such as race or ethnicity, they should define how they measured the variables and justify their relevance.(b)  Technical informationIdentify the methods, apparatus (give the manufacturers name and address in parentheses), and procedures in sufficient detail to allow other workers to reproduce the results. Give references to established methods, including statistical methods (see below); provide references and brief descriptions for methods that have been published but are not well known; describe new or substantially modified methods, give reasons for using them, and evaluate their limitations. Identify precisely all drugs and chemicals used, includ-ing generic name(s), dose(s), and route(s) of administration. Also describe diagnostic or therapeutic procedures if part of the study design. Describe statistical methods with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. When possible, quantify findings and present them with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty (such as confidence intervals). Define statistical terms, abbreviations, and most symbols. Specify the computer soft-ware used. ResultsResultsPresent your results in logical sequence in the text, tables, and illustrations, giving the main or most important findings first. Do not repeat in the text all the data in the tables or illustrations; emphasize or summarize only important observations.When data are summarized in the Results section, give numeric results not only as derivatives (for example, percentages) but also as the absolute numbers from which the derivatives were calculated, and specify the statistical methods used to analyze them. Restrict tables and figures to those needed to explain the argument of the paper and to assess its support. Use graphs as an alternative to tables with many entries; do not duplicate data in graphs and tables. DiscussionDiscussionEmphasize the new and important aspects of the study and the conclusions that follow from them. Do not repeat in detail data or other material given in the Introduction or the Results section. For experimental studies it is useful to begin the discussion by summarizing briefly the main findings, then explore possible mechanisms or explanations for these find-ings, compare and contrast the results with other relevant studies, state the limitations of the study, and explore the implications of the findings for future research and for clinical practice.Link the conclusions with the goals of the study but avoid unqualified statements and conclusions not adequately supported by the data. Avoid claiming priority and alluding to work that has not been completed. State new hypotheses when warranted. ReferencesReferences(a)  General Considerations Related to ReferencesAlthough references to review articles can be an efficient way of guiding readers to a body of literature, review articles do not always reflect original work accurately. Small numbers of references to key original papers will often serve.Avoid using abstracts as references. References to papers accepted but not yet published should be designated as in press authors should obtain written permission to cite such papers as well as verification that they have been accepted for publication. Informa-tion from manuscripts submitted but not accepted should be cited in the text as unpublished observations with written permission from the source.Avoid citing a personal communication unless it provides essential information not available from a public source, in which case the name of the person and date of communication should be cited in parentheses in the text. For scientific articles, authors should obtain written permission and confirmation of accuracy from the source of a personal communication.For articles published in journals indexed in MEDLINE, the Annals of KEMU considers PubMed (http:www.pubmed.gov) the authoritative source for information about retractions.(b)  Reference Style and Format The Uniform Requirements style is based largely on an ANSI standard style adapted by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) for its databases. For samples of reference citation formats, authors should consult National Library of Medicine web site.References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are first mentioned in the text. Identify references in text, tables, and legends by Arabic numerals in parentheses. The titles of journals should be abbreviated according to the style used in Index Medicus. Consult the list of Journals Indexed for MEDLINE, published annually as a separate publication by the National Library of Medicine. TablesTablesTables capture information concisely, and display it efficiently; they also provide information at any desired level of detail and precision. Including data in tables rather than text frequently makes it possible to reduce the length of the text.Type or print each table with double spacing on a separate sheet of paper. Number tables consecutively in the order of their first citation in the text and supply a brief title for each. Do not use internal horizontal or vertical lines. Give each column a short or abbreviated heading. Authors should place explanatory matter in footnotes, not in the heading. Be sure that each table is cited in the text. Illustrations (Figures)Illustrations (Figures)Figures should be either professionally drawn and photo-graphed, or submitted as photographic quality digital prints. In addition to requiring a version of the figures suitable for printing, Annals of KEMU ask authors for electronic files of figures in a format (e.g., JPEG or GIF) that will produce high quality images in the web version of the journal; authors should review the images.For x-ray films, scans, and other diagnostic images, as well as pictures of pathology specimens or photomicrographs, send sharp, glossy, black-and-white or color photo-graphic prints, usually 127 x 173 mm (5 x 7 inches). Letters, numbers, and symbols on Figures should therefore be clear and even throughout, and of sufficient size that when reduced for publication each item will still be legible. Figures should be made as self-explanatory as possible, since many will be used directly in slide presentations. Titles and de-tailed explanations belong in the legends, however, not on the illustrations themselves.Photomicrographs should have internal scale markers. Symbols, arrows, or letters used in photomicrographs should contrast with the background.If photographs of people are used, either the subjects must not be identifiable or their pictures must be accompanied by written permission to use the photograph. When-ever possible permission for publication should be obtained.Figures should be numbered consecutively according to the order in which they have been first cited in the text. Legends for Illustrations (Figures)Legends for Illustrations (Figures)Type or print out legends for illustrations using double spacing, starting on a separate page, with Arabic numerals cor-responding to the illustrations. When symbols, arrows, numbers, or letters are used to identify parts of the illustrations, identify and explain each one clearly in the legend. Units of Measurement Units of MeasurementMeasurements of length, height, weight, and volume should be reported in metric units (meter, kilogram, or liter) or their decimal multiples.Temperatures should be in degrees Celsius. Blood pressures should be in millimeters of mercury, unless other units are specifically required. Abbreviations and SymbolsAbbreviations and SymbolsUse only standard abbreviations; the use of non-standard abbreviations can be extremely confusing to readers. Avoid abbreviations in the title. The full term for which Drug NameDrug NameGeneric names should be used. When proprietary brands are used in research, include the brand name and the name of the manufacturer in parentheses after first mentioning of the generic name in the Methods section.

Different tests are used to determine a candidate's job suitability including verbal reasoning, logical reasoning, situational judgment and numerical reasoning.Psychometric aptitude tests measure a candidates abilities as well as their intelligence levels and help explore aptitude which pertains to numerical, verbal and logical skills to determine problem-solving and information processing speed.Other psychometric assessments explore personality, behavior and emotional intelligence to look at how candidates communicate as well as their potential for leadership.It is common for candidates to appear to be a good fit for a role based on their skills, but experience will tell even the best recruitment and hiring managers that skills and industry background arent always a good fit - or the thing that always matters.Factors such as personality traits, approach to work and communication skills are significant in predicting how well-suited someone is to a job role and organization.A psychometric test helps to provide insight into a candidates personality traits as well as revealing their logical processes, aptitude for problem-solving, and ability to interpret and analyze a range of data.Why psychometric tests are used in the recruitment processTypically, candidates are assessed by reviewing their CV or resume, conducting an interview (or a series of interviews), and perhaps assigning them a task or project. But why do other employers use psychometric tests?Psychometric tools in recruitment offer more detailed and insightful information than these traditional assessment methods. They can help to assess aptitude or the type of personality, and explore things like an individuals communication style, emotional intelligence and behaviors as they relate directly to the workplace.These insights allow employers to determine how well you might work within a team, your management style and your willingness to follow the rules or take risks, for example. These are all key indicators of whether someone is right for a job within a particular company. Another key element of a psychometric assessment is that it provides interviewers with a personality assessment that helps them to understand how suited a candidate is to different roles - i.e. assessing whether a candidate is suitable for a client facing role or if they will fit well into an existing team - and these are just two examples of the advantages of using psychometric testing.Another advantage is that not all candidates interview particularly well - they may have an off day or a mental block to interviews, a psychometric test removes the reliance on interviews. By asking scenario based questions, interviewers can build a better idea of a candidate based on their responses as they play into the psychometric analysis.Many experts in the recruitment industry have warned against over-reliance on psychometric tests, noting that over-using aptitude tests can put potential applicants off and unnecessary personality assessments can cause emotional upset in some candidates.Critically psychometric testing insights provide value long after the initial recruitment process. Not only can they reaffirm the caliber of a recruit, but they also equip hiring managers with the information needed to inform future progression conversations and ensure high levels of job satisfaction and engagement.Psychometric tests must be: Objective- Score must be unaffected by the assessor's beliefs or values Standardized- Tests must be consistent and administered under controlled conditions Reliable- Errors must be minimized Predictive- Tests must provide an accurate prediction of performance Nondiscriminatory- Tests mustnt put any group at a disadvantage due to race, age, genderWhat recruiters are looking for with psychometric testingDepending on the role, hiring managers will look for different things when conducting skills assessment tests for employment. Take a high-pressured Head of Marketing position as an example. This post might require an individual that works well in stressful environments, communicates effectively with stakeholders at all levels, and someone whos a natural-born leader.On the other hand, a technical IT vacancy may call for an individual who is both methodical and disciplined and works well independently. In the same way, youd want a team leader to possess high levels of emotional intelligence, while an editor will need to demonstrate a solid score for error checking (there is, in fact, a psychometric test that looks at an individuals ability to spot inaccuracies in information).For each of the scenarios, theres a specific psychometric test or series of tests that will measure each of the individual traits explored.Psychometric tests however provide other benefits to the recruitment process including: Eliminating unsuitable candidates at an early stage Screening candidates for interviews Objectively determining someones ability, personality, motivation, values and reactions to their environments Identifying the strengths or weaknesses missing in existing teams and helping to make strategic recruitment decisions Providing management with guidance on career progression for existing employeesAnd there are additional reasons why recruiters use psychometric testing which include: Best predictor of job performance. By including test results in the decision-making process, you increase the chances of making a good hire who better fits your company culture. Decision making is supported by objective data. Deeper candidate insights help when selections need to be made. Provide added value for candidates. Personality questionnaires and situational judgment assessments prompt candidates to consider their thinking and attitudes. Also - discussing tests with candidates helps improve their self awareness. Helps with candidate onboarding. Positive onboarding experiences are key in retaining top talent. Helps with long term employee development. Training and development can be better personalized to the individual needs of new hires. Reduces hiring bias.Does psychometric testing work in recruitment?Psychometric assessments are said to help employers make more effective and informed decisions in the hiring process, generating more information about a candidate, showcasing strengths and weaknesses and identifying potential progression opportunities for later on.But do they really work?Studies have shown that psychometric testing can, indeed, save time and money while recruiting, and employers have admitted to feeling more confident when choosing candidates. Experts in the field maintain the reliability and accuracy of these tests but also advise that these tools are best used alongside traditional methods such as face-to-face interviews. One study found that 75 of The Times Top 100 Companies were using psychometric testing alongside other tried and tested recruitment methods and tools.A psychometric test for recruitment benchmarks candidates in a way that is often difficult to do with other methods, such as interviews. By scoring candidates on set criteria, it becomes easier to distinguish standout candidates and shortlist the most promising ones more quickly.With all that said, more traditional assessment methods do still have a place in recruitment. In other words, psychometric tests on their own are not enough to inform all hiring decisions. Companies can make the most out of their recruitment process when using psychometric testing alongside other traditional recruitment methods. And its crucial to ensure recruiting is performed optimally, given the costs of poor hiring. In fact, the cost of a poor hire doesnt only relate to recruitment fees, training and loss of productivity - it can also have a severe impact on company morale and culture.Advantages of psychometric testing work in recruitmentPsychometric tests are designed to provide objective and measurable data to help managers make informed decisions for hiring. Psychometric assessments for recruitment provide insight into candidate intelligence levels, values, as well as behaviors and motivations.In other words, they can help managers delve into how and why a candidate might act a certain way, for instance, during a high-pressure sales call or when working as part of a team. Psychometric testing can assist hiring managers in:1. Understanding how people will behave at work Understanding how someone will behave in the workplace is key to hiring. Psychometric tools that focus on behavior and personality will be able to provide you with data indicating a candidates preferred communication styles, their ability to stay calm under pressure and what motivates them as an individual.2. Identifying leadership potential in job applicantsA key determinant of leadership potential, leadership assessment tests will help you determine whether or not a candidate could be a future leader . In doing so, they can support better succession planning. The insight these kinds of tests offer help to inform 121s where progression is a crucial point of discussion. They can also maximize engagement and ambition levels among employees.3. Accurately testing general intelligence of candidatesPsychometric assessments explore aptitude and ability by measuring a candidates intelligence levels against others. This method of measuring cognitive ability can inform how long it might take a candidate to pick up new skills, how well theyll deal with words or numbers on the job, and how quickly they might process information, for example.4. Interpreting candidate emotions and their ability to maintain relationshipsBy assessing the emotional intelligence of a candidate with psychometric tests during recruitment, you can derive how well they might work with other team members, understand their specific way of communicating with others and predict what kind of manager they might be.What are the key benefits of psychometric tests in recruitment?Up until now, weve focused mainly on the benefits of psychometric tests as they pertain to employee assessment ; however, the organizational gains extend well beyond this. Integration of psychometric assessment with the candidate selection process can result in recruitment efforts that are more time-efficient, cost-effective, consistent and standardized.As a result, psychometric testing can become an invaluable business asset that not only streamlines recruitment but also ensures a robust selection process, designed to surface only the most suitable candidates.  Psychometric assessments help:1. Bolster face-to-face interviewsFace-to-face interviews whether structured or unstructured  help to form an initial impression of a candidate. That said, nerves can present a real factor in how someone might come across. For instance, someone could perform terribly in an interview but possess all the skills and characteristics needed for the job.In the same way, a candidate who gives a great interview doesnt always equal a great employee. Using psychometric tools alongside interviews means you dont have to rely on face-to-face performance alone. Youll have more takeaways and insights to hand, which helps to make decision making a lot easier.2. Save time across the recruitment processPsychometric tests offer a great deal of information about a candidate in a short space of time. That makes these tests an invaluable investment for mass recruitment drives, such as graduate assessments when youll need to whittle down to a shortlist from a large pool of applicants as quickly as possible.3. Highlight candidate skills and abilities (rather than just education and experience) A candidates CV or resume may outline their professional achievements and educational background, but it wont necessarily delve into a detailed skillset review relevant to the role being recruited. This data is invaluable in identifying the right skills or personality traits for the particular vacancy in question.4. Forge consistency throughout recruitmentPsychometric testing allows you to work with a trustworthy model time and time again, creating uniformity at macro and even micro recruitment levels. It also offers benchmarks and insights you can revisit later down the line to help with the progression and engagement of future employees.What are the different types of psychometric tests?Psychometric assessment tools are suited to different purposes and outcomes, and we can work with you to identify which tests will be right for your organization. Of all the traits psychometric tests evaluate, there are four main groupings or categories: aptitude, behaviors, personality and emotional intelligence.While aptitude measures cognitive abilities, behavior testing will look at how a candidate acts or communicates. Personality testing explores candidate traits and how they might fit with a particular role whereas E.I., or emotional intelligence, can be measured through its own set of tests. Heres a more detailed breakdown of the different types of psychometric tests available.Psychometric aptitude testingPsychometric aptitude tests are used to measure a candidates cognitive abilities. With these types of tests, theres usually a minimum score, which will help to determine intelligence levels in an individual. Lets take a look at the different types of aptitude tests available: Numerical- As the name suggests, numerical psychometric tests will explore how quickly and easily a candidate works with numbers. Verbal- Verbal psychometric tests will explore a candidates understanding and comprehension skills with written extracts, usually with a multiple-choice answer format. Inductive- This type of psychometric tool will measure the candidates ability to think methodically, usually using graphic sequences. Diagrammatic- These types of tests will explore a candidates ability to problem-solve. Typically, candidates will get about one minute to answer each question. Logical- Just like youd expect, these tests are designed to measure an individuals ability to think logically. These tests are similar to diagrammatic testing, but may not use diagrams. Error checking- This ones also reasonably self-explanatory, gauging how a candidate identifies errors within information.Behavior testingBy assessing and understanding a candidates behavioral style, we can explore things such as their preferred way of communicating, how they might handle setbacks, or how they would approach managing a team.This kind of insight is crucial in identifying development areas, maximizing engagement and establishing whether an individual would be a good cultural fit for a team or organization.One example of behavioral tests is Thomas Personal Profile Analysis (PPA) which is rooted in William Moulton Marstons DISC theory uses four main profile factors: Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Compliance to provide information on an assessment takers fears, motivators, values and behavioral style. In order to complete the PPA, candidates choose two trait adjectives from a block of four, one 'most like' and one least like them. This process is repeated 24 times, giving 48 choices from a total of 96 words. An individuals response patterns are compared to themselves rather than the scores of a comparison group.Personality testingPersonality tests (also known as occupational tests) measure a candidates suitability for a role by exploring interests, values and behaviors.One example of a workplace personality assessment is Thomas High Potential Trait Indicator (HPTI) that provides insight into how individuals approach their work and whether their strengths may become their derailers. Specifically, it can help identify leadership potential by exploring a persons personality traits.The Thomas HPTI is a self-report questionnaire where candidates are asked to indicate their level of agreement on a 1-7 Likert scale (1 disagree completely to 7 agree completely) across 78 questions.The benefits of personality testing are similar to those of behavioral tests and will help determine how well an individual will integrate within a team or company.Emotional intelligence testingA person who is highly emotionally intelligent will be much better equipped to recognize their emotions and those of their peers. They are also able to use that information to inform thinking and behaviors. By testing emotional intelligence in candidates, we can identify how effectively they can communicate with others in the workplace.One example of emotional intelligence testing would be the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire also known as the TEIQue. This test of more than 150 questions explores 15 different traits in a candidate, including sociability, self-control and wellbeing. Similarly, the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (or EIQ), will review a candidates attitude to the likes of influencing, integrity and intuition.As with behavior and personality testing, evaluating a candidate's level of emotional intelligence can help establish if there will be a strong culture fit. The results may also indicate whether a particular candidate shows the potential to lead, as emotional intelligence plays a key role in effective management and leadership.Thomas psychometric assessmentsThomas behavioural assessmentIn 8 minutes, this simple assessment involving just 24 questions will help you to uncover and understand more about the candidate and how they behave and why they respond in certain ways to a variety of situations.Thomas workplace personality assessmentIn this 10 minute assessment , candidates will answer 78 questions which will provide a wide ranging report. Powered by High Potential Trait Indicator (HPTI) which was developed by Ian MacRae and Adrian Furnham in 2006, this assessment is a powerful tool in understanding your candidates.Thomas aptitude assessmentThe Thomas aptitude test involves 5 online assessments and takes between 30 to 45 minutes to complete. Known as the  General Intelligence Assessment, or GIA, the GIA  is a cognitive ability assessment that can help to predict how quickly an individual will take to get to grips with a new role or regime.

What tools are used for succession planning? How to develop a succession planning process Internal staff development vs external recruitment In summarySuccession planning is a proactive process that identifies and develops employees to fill key leadership positions within a business or organization. It involves planning for the future by identifying potential candidates and creating a strategy to develop their skills and knowledge to prepare them for leadership roles. When the global pandemic brought workplaces to a halt, many organizations acknowledged an increased need for organizational resilience, with McKinsey consulting claiming that organizations need to radically rethink their workforce planning . Succession planning is crucial for organizational success as it ensures continuity in leadership, reduces risks associated with leadership transitions, and supports business growth and sustainability.At Thomas, we have been conducting research into people performance and developing people insights software since the inception of psychometric solutions more than forty years ago, to help organizations like yours identify natural leadership qualities, understand the effect of personality traits on a team, and gain a 360-degree view of your people development needs. Todays fast paced business environment requires organizations to rapidly upskill their people and build robust talent pipelines, so weve brought together some of our experts knowledge to share with you.This guide will cover the importance of succession planning, the steps involved in creating a succession plan, such as identifying key positions, assessing current employees, and developing a training and development plan. We will also discuss how to implement and maintain a successful plan by tracking progress, monitoring potential candidates, and adjusting the plan as needed.What is succession planning?Succession planning is a process of identifying and developing internal staff to fill key positions in a company, ensuring a smooth transition of leadership when new resource requirements arise. It involves evaluating the skills and abilities of current employees and preparing them to take on future roles, enabling organizations to fill key positions with qualified candidates who are already familiar with the company's culture, values, and goals. Succession planning is a strategic approach that ensures that companies have the right people in the right positions at the right time.The aims of succession planning are to develop a pipeline of internal talent who can fill key positions in the company, reducing the need for external recruitment. Succession planning aims to identify employees with the potential to take on leadership roles and develop their skills and abilities to prepare them for future opportunities. By developing internal talent, organizations can reduce the costs associated with external recruitment, such as advertising, interviewing, and training costs. Additionally, internal candidates already have a strong understanding of the organization's culture, processes, and values, which can result in a faster transition and more effective leadership. Succession planning is a critical process that enables organizations to identify and develop internal talent to fill key positions, ensuring a smooth transition of leadership and reducing the need for external recruitment. Succession planning involves evaluating current employees, developing a training and development plan, and monitoring progress to ensure that the organization has a pipeline of qualified candidates to fill key positions. By developing internal talent, organizations can save costs associated with external recruitment, ensure a smooth leadership transition, and improve overall organizational performance.Why is a succession plan important for businesses?Succession planning is critical for organizations to prepare for future leadership needs and ensure a smooth transition of leadership when necessary. Succession planning reduces the risk of losing critical knowledge and expertize when key employees leave the company. It also helps to develop and retain internal talent, which can lead to higher employee engagement and job satisfaction. Succession planning can also help to reduce the cost of recruitment by developing and promoting internal staff instead of hiring externally.By developing a pool of potential leaders, organizations can ensure that they have the right people in the right positions at the right time, reducing the risk of disruption in operations. Succession planning is a proactive approach to managing the talent pool, ensuring the continuity of business operations and growth. It helps organizations to identify and develop the necessary skills and competencies required for future leadership positions.Moreover, succession planning ensures that businesses have a robust leadership pipeline that is ready to fill critical positions in a timely manner. Succession planning also ensures that businesses have a diverse and inclusive leadership team that represents the company's values, mission, and culture. In conclusion, succession planning is essential for businesses and organizations to prepare for the future and ensure a smooth transition of leadership. It helps to reduce risk, develop internal talent, reduce costs, and ensure continuity of business operations and growth.What are the key benefits of succession planning?Succession planning is a proactive approach to developing and retaining top talent within an organization. It involves identifying and developing internal staff who have the potential to fill key positions in the future, ensuring that the organization can continue to operate smoothly and grow, even when key individuals leave.Business insuranceThink of succession planning as business insurance. Any top talent can be lured away to another company or can just leave, making it smart to have a plan in place to ensure there are other candidates who can take on that role. Succession planning also helps identify future leaders by finding the positions that are most critical to the future success of the company and the internal candidates with the values, skills, and desire to take on those positions.Structured development One of the benefits of succession planning is that it structures development and training. By finding potential successors early, you will have time to develop a training and development program to ensure that they have the skills required to take on certain roles in advance. This will also motivate other employees to work hard, as they will want the opportunity to develop.Preservation of brand identityMaintaining brand identity is another significant benefit of succession planning. By creating an internal succession plan, you get people from within your business moving up and maintaining the brand identity, the company culture, and its core values. This ensures that the organization's culture remains consistent, even when leadership changes.Cost efficacySuccession planning also cuts recruitment and onboarding costs. By promoting internally, there is less need for onboarding, and the high costs of recruitment are reduced. Finally, succession planning increases engagement. Employees who know there are growth and opportunity awaiting will receive a self-esteem boost, resulting in a more engaged workforce.What are the four stages of in a strong succession planning format?Aptitude tests are scored and marked using various methods, depending on the type of test and its objectives. For example, some tests are scored based on the number of correct answers, while others take into account factors such as speed, accuracy, or problem-solving skills. The most common scoring methods include percentile ranking, standard deviation, and raw scores. Percentile ranking compares a candidate's score with others who have taken the same test, while standard deviation measures how closely a candidate's score aligns with the average score of the test takers. Raw scores, on the other hand, are based on the total number of correct answers.To interpret results, it is important to have a clear understanding of the scoring method used and what the scores mean for the particular test. It is also essential to consider other factors, such as the candidate's experience, qualifications, and soft skills, when evaluating and comparing test scores. One best practice is to establish a benchmark for what constitutes a successful score for the specific role or position, based on the requirements and responsibilities of the job. Comparing candidates' scores against this benchmark can help identify the best candidates for the role. It is also important to remember that aptitude tests are only one aspect of the recruitment process and should be used in conjunction with other factors, such as interviews, resumes, and references, to make informed decisions about candidates.1. Initiating the succession planning process The initial stage of succession planning involves identifying the need for succession planning and making a commitment to implement it. This may involve assessing the organization's leadership needs and the potential risks associated with key personnel leaving the company. Once the need for succession planning has been established, the next step is to establish a team or committee to oversee the succession planning process. This team will be responsible for identifying key positions within the organization, assessing current employees, and developing a training and development plan to prepare potential successors for leadership roles.It is also important to communicate the need and benefits of succession planning to relevant stakeholders, such as senior management, HR, and employees. This can help to gain buy-in and support for the process, and ensure that all stakeholders understand the importance of succession planning and their role in the process. Effective communication can also help to manage expectations and address any concerns or misconceptions about the process. In conclusion, the initial stage of succession planning involves identifying the need, establishing a team, and communicating the need and benefits of the process to stakeholders.2. Selection of key positions and high potential employeesThe second phase of succession planning involves identifying key positions within the organization, assessing the current talent pool, evaluating potential successors, and creating a development and training plan to prepare them for leadership roles. The selection process may involve determining the required competencies and behaviors for each key position and identifying high-potential employees who could potentially fill key positions in the future. Once potential successors have been identified, the next step is to evaluate their readiness and potential to take on key leadership roles.Internal talent evaluation can involve assessing their current skills and experience, as well as their potential to develop the necessary competencies and behaviors required for leadership positions. It is also important to consider factors such as their motivation, engagement, and fit with the organization's culture and values. The assessment process should be based on objective criteria and conducted in a fair and consistent manner to ensure that all potential successors have an equal opportunity to be evaluated. Once the assessment process is complete, the organization is ready to take the next steps in creating a succession plan that outlines the development and training required for potential successors to prepare them for leadership roles.3. Developing high potential successorsOnce potential successors have been identified, the next step is to create a personal development plan for each individual to ensure that potential successors have the necessary skills, knowledge, and experience to succeed in future leadership roles, ensuring the continuity of the organization's success. Creating development plans involves assessing high potential employees current skills and experience and identifying the training and development opportunities required to prepare them for future leadership roles. This may look like formal training, such as courses or workshops, or on-the-job training, such as mentoring or coaching. Creating opportunities for successors to gain experience through job shadowing or stretch assignments is another effective way to develop their skills and build their confidence. This can help to expose them to different parts of the business and develop a broader understanding of the organization's operations. Feedback and coaching are also essential to support the development of successors. Regular feedback can help to identify areas for improvement and reinforce positive behaviors. Coaching can also help to develop specific skills, such as communication or leadership, and provide support and guidance as successors navigate their development journey.4. Transitioning successors into leadership positionsTransitioning successors into key positions within an organization is a critical step in ensuring the continuity of business operations and growth. Once a successor has been identified and developed, it is important to carefully manage the transition process to ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities.This involves providing ongoing support and training to the new leader to ensure they have the necessary skills, knowledge, and support to succeed in their new role. This support may include coaching, mentoring, and providing access to resources and tools to help them succeed. It is also important to establish clear expectations and goals for the new leader to help them navigate their new role effectively. Transitioning successors into key positions requires careful planning, ongoing support, and a commitment to continuous improvement.Evaluation of your business succession plan is also crucial to ensure its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments for future success. You may want to collect feedback from the new leader, stakeholders, and other relevant parties to identify strengths and areas for improvement in the succession planning process. Adjustments can then be implemented, such as refining the selection process for potential successors, improving training and development programs, or modifying the transition process to better support new leaders.Implementing succession planning successfully is a substantial piece of work, but by investing in the development of internal talent, organizations can ensure the continuity of business operations and growth, while also boosting employee engagement and retention.What tools are used for succession planning? It is important to note that succession planning is not a simple process, and it involves various challenges. Despite what some people may think, it is a strategic process that necessitates a great deal of consideration. During the pandemic, businesses of all sizes began to recognize the importance of succession planning due to the impact that abrupt changes can have on a company. It is critical to be prepared to transfer ownership to new leaders who can guide the company in a new direction. Although selecting the appropriate leaders is not always enough, the absence of a plan can create additional problems when a decision needs to be made. To ensure that businesses can adapt and have a plan in place, they require a succession planning toolkit. This toolkit helps to identify any potential gaps in succession and allows for the planning of future staffing needs. This is achieved by clarifying the role and measuring values, attainment, and perseverance, which enables informed decisions to be made.We will now review the tools that organizations have available to help them deliver objective, fair and effective succession planning programs.Technical assessmentsTechnical assessments are evaluations that measure an employee's knowledge, skills, and abilities in a specific area or field. They are a critical component of a succession planning process as they assist in identifying potential successors for key roles within an organization. Technical assessments can provide valuable insight into an employee's strengths and weaknesses, helping to identify areas where training or development may be necessary.In a succession planning process, technical assessments can be used to identify individuals who have the necessary skills and knowledge to fill critical roles within the organization. These assessments can be used to evaluate an employee's ability to perform tasks, solve problems, and make decisions in a specific area. Technical assessments can also be used to identify employees who may need additional training or development to prepare them for future roles. Aptitude testsAn aptitude test is a tool used to evaluate a candidate's potential to perform in a particular role. These tests measure a candidate's cognitive abilities, such as numerical, verbal, logical, and spatial reasoning. They are designed to assess the candidate's potential to learn and adapt to new tasks and situations in a specific field. The results of aptitude tests can be used to determine the candidate's strengths and weaknesses, and to identify areas where further training or development may be necessary. Aptitude tests are an effective way for employers to assess a candidate's potential to succeed in a particular role. Behavioral tools Behavioral assessments are a type of tool used to evaluate a candidate's behavior and personality traits. They are used to assess qualities such as emotional intelligence, work style, and communication skills. These assessments can include a variety of tools, such as personality tests, situational judgment tests, and simulations. The results of these assessments can provide insights into how a candidate is likely to behave in certain situations, how they will work with others, and their potential for success in a particular role. Overall, behavioral assessments can be valuable tools for employers in identifying candidates who have the personality traits and behavioral tendencies necessary for success in a given role. Personality assessmentsPersonality assessments are tools used to evaluate a candidate's personality traits, values, and interests. These assessments are designed to identify the candidate's behavioral tendencies and may be used to predict their fit for a particular job and potential for success in that role. By understanding a candidate's personality, employers can identify their strengths and weaknesses, assess how they will interact with colleagues, and determine if they align with the company culture. Overall, personality assessments can be a valuable tool in the hiring process, helping employers to identify candidates who are the best fit for a particular role and the company culture. 360-degree feedback360-degree feedback is a tool used to evaluate an employee's performance and potential by gathering feedback from a range of sources including their peers, subordinates, and superiors. This tool provides a comprehensive view of an employee's strengths and weaknesses, as well as areas for improvement. By collecting feedback from multiple sources, 360-degree feedback can provide a well-rounded view of an employee's performance and potential, helping them to identify areas for development and growth. Overall, 360-degree feedback can be a useful tool for companies to support employee development, improve performance, and drive organizational success.How to develop a succession planning processFinding the right individuals to lead your organization is critical to business success and competitiveness. But with the average tenure of a C-suite leader ranging from 3-8 years, effective succession planning can be the difference between continued success or potential failure. Succession planning isnt a one-time activity, rather its an ongoing process that provides a safeguard in the event of an unexpected departure, a transition plan for a managed handover, and a method for developing a pipeline of leadership talent.Create a strategy for identifying and developing future leaders at your company at all levels. Make sure you have plans in place to address the inevitable changes that occur when employees leave by training high-potential workers for advancement into key roles. Instilling a succession planning model into your HR function protects your assets within the business and prepares you for the time when key players will inevitably depart. Understanding the value of leadership development and succession planning gives organizations the strength of business continuity with minimal interruption, positioning them for a stronger outcome. Below are the key steps for how to develop a succession planning process for your organisation so you can begin preparing for the future:Identify your future needsTo develop a successful succession planning process for your business, it is important to identify your organization's needs. First, it is crucial to assess the company's long-term goals and objectives to understand the direction in which the organization is moving. Next, it is essential to identify the key positions that will need to be filled in the future and the timeframe in which they are likely to become vacant.Once these positions have been identified, it is necessary to determine the skills and knowledge required to fill these positions. This can involve a review of the job description, qualifications, and experience of the current position holder, as well as an evaluation of the competencies required for the role. By identifying the business' needs, organizations can develop a succession plan that aligns with their goals, helps to identify future leaders, and ensures the continuity of the business.Identify key positions, competencies and behaviorsTo identify key roles, competencies, and behaviors in a succession planning process, there are several steps that organizations can take. Firstly, it is essential to identify the key roles within the organization that are critical to its success. These may include roles that are responsible for driving revenue, managing key projects, or leading teams.Once these roles have been identified, it is important to define the competencies and behaviors required for each role. This can include technical skills, leadership abilities, communication skills, and emotional intelligence. To evaluate the current employees who hold those positions and assess their potential for advancement, organizations can use a range of tools, such as performance evaluations, 360-degree feedback, and assessments. This can help to identify high-potential employees who have the necessary competencies and behaviors to succeed in key roles, as well as any areas where additional development or training may be required.Select high potential candidates and invite them to participateSelecting high-potential employees is a critical step in developing a succession plan. To identify these employees, organizations should consider a range of factors, including performance evaluations, 360-degree feedback, and assessments of key competencies and behaviors.Once potential employees have been identified, it is important to invite them to participate in the succession planning process. This can involve discussions about their career aspirations, their current skills and abilities, and any potential development opportunities. Career path and succession planning are intrinsically tied. Succession planning isnt just about reacting to a senior person leaving. It should also be a continuous investment and process that reaps rewards for your existing employees and prospective hires. By outlining the clear path for opportunities that exist within your organization, you are likely to discover ambitious and suitable applicants that meet your criteria while also increasing employee engagement. By involving employees in the succession planning process, organizations can provide them with a clear understanding of the skills and competencies required for key roles and support their career development. Additionally, these discussions can help to identify any potential gaps in skills or experience that may need to be addressed through training or development opportunities.Assess for high potential and performanceTo effectively evaluate employee potential and performance, organizations can use a combination of assessments. Aptitude tests can be used to evaluate an employee's cognitive abilities and potential to learn and adapt to new tasks and situations in a specific field. Behavioral tools, such as personality tests and situational judgment tests, can provide valuable insights into an employee's behavioral tendencies, work style, and communication skills. Additionally, personality assessments can help to identify employees who have the personality traits necessary for success in a particular role.To further assess performance, organizations can use performance data to identify employees who consistently demonstrate high performance. This can include data from employee evaluations, sales reports, and customer feedback. By identifying employees who consistently demonstrate high performance, organizations can identify potential candidates for future leadership roles. Using a combination of assessments and performance data can help organizations to effectively evaluate employee potential and performance, identify high-potential employees, and develop a pipeline of future leaders. By developing a robust succession planning process, organizations can ensure the continuity of critical roles and support the growth and development of employees.Select training and development activitiesOrganizations should identify training and development opportunities that align with the company's goals and objectives. This can involve providing employees with opportunities to develop the competencies and behaviors required for key positions, as well as supporting their career aspirations. To achieve this, organizations can consider a range of options, including stretch projects, formal training, executive coaching, and accelerated leadership programs.Stretch projects can provide employees with opportunities to work on projects outside of their comfort zone and develop new skills. Formal training can help employees to develop specific technical skills or competencies. Executive coaching can provide one-on-one support for employees to develop their leadership skills, while accelerated leadership programs can prepare employees for future leadership roles within the organization. By identifying training and development needs and opportunities, organizations can support the growth and development of employees, ensure the continuity of critical roles, and develop a pipeline of highly capable future leaders.Implement a personal development plan Implementing a personal development plan can help employees to achieve their career goals and support the growth and development of the organization. To create a successful personal development plan, employers should work with employees to identify their goals and objectives. This can involve discussing career aspirations, skills gaps, and areas for improvement. Once goals have been identified, employers can work with employees to identify the training and development activities required to achieve these goals. This can involve identifying stretch projects, formal training, executive coaching, and accelerated leadership programs. To monitor progress towards these goals, employers should set regular check-ins to review progress and adjust the development plan as necessary.Stretch projectsStretch projects are a powerful tool for developing high-potential employees and preparing them for future leadership roles within an organization. These projects are typically more challenging and complex than an employee's regular job duties and require them to stretch beyond their comfort zone. By taking on these projects, employees are exposed to new skills, knowledge, and experiences that can help them to develop the competencies and behaviors required for leadership roles. Stretch projects can also provide employees with opportunities to work with different teams, build their networks, and gain exposure to different areas of the organization.Formal trainingFormal training, such as leadership development programs, can play a critical role in developing the skills necessary for leadership roles. These programs are designed to provide employees with the knowledge, skills, and tools required to lead teams and drive business success. By participating in formal training, employees can develop a range of competencies, including communication skills, strategic thinking, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. Additionally, leadership development programs can provide employees with exposure to different leadership styles, best practices, and real-world case studies. This can help employees to build their confidence and develop their leadership skills.Executive coachingExecutive coaching is a personalized approach to leadership development that provides one-on-one support for individuals in leadership roles. Through executive coaching, leaders can work with a professional coach to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, like executive development consultancies Live and Learn and Zentano Group .Executive coaching can involve exploring leadership styles, communication skills, problem-solving abilities, and emotional intelligence. By working with an executive coach, leaders can receive personalized support and guidance on how to develop their skills, build their confidence, and overcome challenges. Executive coaching can also provide leaders with opportunities to receive feedback, reflect on their experiences, and gain new insights into their leadership style.Accelerated leadership programs Accelerated leadership programs, such as the leadership development program at Danamon bank , are intensive training and development programs designed to prepare high-potential employees for leadership roles within an organization. These programs provide employees with opportunities to develop key competencies and behaviors required for leadership roles, such as strategic thinking, problem-solving, communication, and emotional intelligence. Additionally, accelerated leadership programs often involve exposure to senior leaders, experiential learning, and networking opportunities. This can help employees to build their confidence, gain exposure to different areas of the organization, and build their networks. By participating in accelerated leadership programs, high-potential employees can accelerate their growth and development, increase their engagement and job satisfaction, and prepare themselves for future leadership roles.Monitor and evaluateMonitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the succession planning process is crucial to ensure that the organization is achieving its objectives and preparing for future success. By monitoring the process, organizations can assess whether the goals and objectives of the succession planning process are being met, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary adjustments. But how should organizations understand success?Academic achievement as a measurement of success has taken more of a back seat recently, in favor of using general intelligence and conscientious personality traits as predictors of job success. The role of emotional intelligence as a critical leadership skill has also received considerable attention over the past few years. Managing the evaluation and review of your succession planning template can be managed through means of panel reviews or assessment centers. Its important to note this should remain flexible and appropriate throughout the entire process to ensure it is effective and efficient.Thomas has a range of psychological tests and assessments which can be used to measure these characteristics: Aptitude assessment (GIA) measures the ability to hold and reason with new information, and solve problems with instructions Emotional Intelligence assessment (TEIQue) helps understand personalities and how best to interact with others to achieve goals Workplace Personality assessment (HPTI) benchmarks against six key traits, analysing approaches to leadership and where there may be room for improvement.Monitoring and evaluating the succession planning process can help organizations to assess the return on investment of the plan and make necessary adjustments to ensure that it is aligned with the long-term goals of the organization as the landscape continues to change.Internal staff development vs external recruitmentThe importance of a solid succession plan is clear: to avoid potential risk caused by business-critical employees exiting the company. The next question is often around whether you should hire a successor externally, or nurture one internally.This decision will depend on a variety of factors, ranging from the cost of an external hire versus developing internal talent, to the time spent with a vacant role, the necessary training, or whether the candidate is the right fit.Finding the right fit Many organizations still focus on identifying candidates who fit their culture. However, this can limit workforce diversity and it is better to focus on finding the right fit for a role and team. When an employee fits well with their role, they are more likely to be engaged, motivated, and productive. In contrast, a poor fit can lead to lower productivity, higher turnover rates, and even negative effects on the company culture itself.Businesses can take two approaches to achieving the right fit: internal staff development and external recruitment. Internal staff development involves investing in current employees by providing training, development opportunities, and career progression pathways. This approach can result in employees who are loyal to the company and have a deep understanding of its culture. External recruitment involves attracting candidates from outside the organization who possess complementary skills, experience, and personality traits that align with the company culture. Combining both approaches can lead to a well-rounded and diverse workforce whose skills and personal motivation are strongly aligned with the objectives of the organization.It takes time to train the right people...Training the right successors for key roles in your organization is a crucial though time-consuming process. Even if you have a perfect succession plan in place, you will rarely achieve a smooth transition, regardless of where you choose to hire from. According to a study by the Center for American Progress (CAP), the average cost to a business in the time between a mission-critical employee leaving, such as a top executive, and their successor reaching peak effectiveness in their new role can be up to 213 of their annual salary.The time it takes an employee to reach optimal productivity will depend on the speed with which they learn new information, their professional background and the sector they have come from. If they have moved firms in the same sector, the time spent on training will be far less significant compared to taking on a recent graduate, for example. As technology advances ever quicker, organizations need to be able to develop their people more efficiently. It is essential to invest in the recruitment and training of new and existing employees to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their role successfully. This will minimize the disruption caused by the departure of key employees and ensure a smooth transition for the organization....And the same goes for training internal talentUpskilling internal talent is a crucial component of any succession plan. Preparing internal talent for business-critical positions can still be expensive and time-consuming. Whether you choose to send employees on courses or hire an internal trainer, you will likely incur significant costs. However, investing in upskilling internal talent can bring numerous benefits to the organization. Development can lead to increased employee satisfaction, higher retention rates, and improved productivity. Additionally, employees who have been trained in-house are more likely to have a deep understanding of the company culture and values. When considering upskilling internal talent, it is essential to calculate the cost implications and return on investment (ROI) for every option. While a great internal, semi-autonomous training course can have organization-wide benefits, it is important to weigh the costs of the program against the potential benefits. One option to consider is to identify high-potential employees who have the necessary skills and interest in the business-critical positions and invest in their training and development. This approach can be more cost-effective than hiring external candidates or bringing in consultants to train existing employees.Developing internal talent within a succession plan is a valuable investment for any organization. However, it is crucial to consider the cost implications and ROI of any upskilling program to ensure that the investment is worthwhile. By investing in internal talent however, businesses can ensure they have a deep bench of skilled employees ready to step into critical roles, improving their resilience and longevity.Talent management programs drive business valueEffective talent management programs are essential for driving business value and ensuring the long-term success of an organization. Talent management programs encompass a range of activities, including recruitment, training and development, performance management, and succession planning. One key benefit of effective talent management is that it can help to drive business value. By having a skilled and engaged workforce, organizations can increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve innovation. Additionally, effective talent management can help to reduce employee turnover, which can be expensive for organizations in terms of recruitment and training costs.Talent management programs also play a vital role in ensuring the long-term success of an organization. By investing in the development of their employees, organizations can create a culture of continuous learning and development, which can help them to stay ahead of the competition. Additionally, by identifying and developing future leaders, organizations can ensure a smooth transition of leadership and maintain business continuity. Effective talent management programs are critical for ensuring the long-term success of an organization. By focusing on attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent, organizations can create a competitive advantage, increase productivity, and achieve long-term sustainability.Employee engagement mattersRecent LinkedIn polls found that employee engagement is currently a top priority for both HR leaders and senior executives , with a Gallup study finding that for every engaged employee, there are two disengaged employees. Employee engagement is a crucial factor in retaining high-potential employees within an organization. Engaged employees are those who are emotionally committed to their work, feel a sense of purpose, and are willing to go the extra mile to achieve their goals. Employee engagement is essential because it impacts organizational productivity , profitability , and overall success. High-potential employees are typically those who have the skills, knowledge, and motivation to become future leaders within the organization. These employees are critical to the success of the organization because they are often the driving force behind innovation and growth. However, if they become disengaged, they may look for opportunities elsewhere, which can lead to significant costs in terms of recruitment, training, and lost productivity. Engaged high-potential employees are more likely to stay with the organization and contribute to its success. Engaged employees are more productive, more innovative, and more likely to take on new challenges. They are also more likely to support the goals and values of the organization, which can help to create a strong culture and sense of purpose.To retain high-potential employees, organizations need to prioritize employee engagement. This can only be achieved by taking a holistic approach to talent management but includes initiatives such as understanding what motivates their people , providing opportunities for professional development, offering competitive compensation packages, and creating a positive work environment. By investing in employee engagement, organizations can create a culture that supports the growth and development of high-potential employees, which is essential for long-term success.Theres no right way to approach recruitmentRecruitment and succession planning are critical activities for any organization, and it's essential to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The approach that works for one organization may not be the best fit for another. Recruitment and succession planning should be tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization, taking into account factors such as the company culture, industry, and future goals.To create a successful recruitment and succession plan, organizations must consider the unique skills and qualities required for each role, as well as the organizational culture and values. In addition, organizations must consider the current and future needs of the business when planning for succession, ensuring that they have a pipeline of skilled and motivated employees who can step into critical roles.By tailoring recruitment and succession planning to meet the specific needs of the organization, companies can create a competitive advantage by attracting and retaining the best talent. Additionally, by investing in the development of employees, organizations can create a culture of continuous learning and development, which is essential for long-term success. Ultimately, successful recruitment and succession planning require a customized approach that takes into account the unique needs of the organization.When torecruit internally Promising employees already exist within the company who could do the job Plenty of notice has been given by the outgoing employee Your company is thriving, and you have the capacity for people to move roles You have an abundance of skills and experience among your workforce Minimal on-boarding and training is required for the role transitionWhen to recruit externally You already have a great candidate in mind who can fill the role quickly You have a tight deadline to fill the position When the stability of the internal structure is delicate and shifting employees may cause trouble There isnt a strong succession plan in place yet, and time constraints make it difficult to create one quickly The required skills and experience arent available You want a fresh perspective in the role You have an effective training plan in place to onboard the new hireSuccession planning in summarySuccession planning is vital to business success. It recognizes the value of key roles within the business functions, the importance of knowledge and skills within your talent pool and prepares you for the inevitable departure of staff to ensure the resilience, brand integrity and sustainability of your business in the long term.Succession plans prevent organizations being let down by resource gaps by providing a model to quickly and effectively fill a position. This reduces recruitment and onboarding costs and protects your business by ensuring there are an abundance of resources for filling crucial leadership and management roles within your company. It also helps to motivate your existing employees and promote a culture of continuous development and excellence.The absence of succession planning can decrease business efficacy and damage your organizations ability to achieve its objectives. It can leave you with gaps in knowledge, expertize and talent that detract from the value your organization offers its stakeholders from customers to employees and board members. Understanding the importance and significance of succession plans within your organization can save you from the potentially disastrous effects that losing key staff can have.If you take a proactive approach to make sure you can replace vital knowledge and skills when someone leaves your organization, your business stands to gain a real advantage.

What is the difference between leadership and management? What are the leadership skills and characteristics of a good manager? The profile of an effective senior leader by Ian MacRae Establishing leadership potential using High Potential Trait Indicator Todays graduates, tomorrows leaders Self-development and the steps towards stronger leadership Your leadership questions answered ConclusionTalented leaders are your organisation's most valuable asset. They are integral for motivating employees, improving performance and your bottom line. But without a well-considered strategy and the right information to make informed decisions, identifying, recruiting, and retaining leaders can be an almost impossible challengeWhats more, as the business landscape continues to change and become increasingly more competitive, you also need a dedicated strategy to help you identify tomorrows leaders today. Get this right, and your business will thrive in the long-term. Get it wrong, and you risk workforce disharmony and rising costs. This comes down to understanding the characteristics of high potential employees , which are high-value players within your organisation and ensuring you nurture their potential.Clarity around the difference between leadership and management is paramount when conducting your leadership strategy. While leadership attributes are focused on a vision, management is about goals. These might sound similar initially, but they offer unique benefits. Recognising the value in each and how to position people correctly within a business can help you thrive.At Thomas International, we use psychometric assessments to help organisations like yours identify effective leadership skills , understand the effect of personality traits on a team, and gain a 360-degree view of your people development needs. Weve been doing this since 1981 and weve brought together some of our knowledge to share with you.This guide will help you understand the characteristics of great leaders, how to predict leadership potential, what best-practice recruitment looks like, and how to develop leadership skills.What is leadership?Leadership is about vision. It is a skill that enables a person to guide or direct individuals , teams and entire organisations to achieve that vision. Leaders are focused on driving everyone toward a common goal through a strategy that encompasses understanding peoples strengths and supporting them. Effective leadership is concentrated on inspiring people through social influence to bring the vision to life.Cohesion and a unified approach are how leaders execute their strategy which is designed to promote growth, increase productivity and support businesses to thrive. Many often think of managers as leaders, but this isnt as clear cut as that. Leadership is defined differently by most people you ask, but most will agree that they bring people together to achieve a shared vision. How that vision is achieved can incorporate a plethora of skills and characteristics which are common among effective leaders. Human skills, often referred to as emotional intelligence including empathy, individualisation and modesty, are attributes that are commonly associated with leaders. Developing leadership skills associated with emotional intelligence can be powerful to ensure people are seen.The impact of leadership within a business can determine whether a business will thrive or dive, so the most important factor within a business around leadership is an internal agreement of what your particular business defines as effective leadership.Leaders can hail from a variety of backgrounds and there is no singular path to achieving leadership within an organisation. Provided the individual can envision how improvements can be made, how to enact the strategy and unite people to work as a team to achieve the end goal, then they are well-positioned to carry the responsibility of leadership.Why is leadership important in business?Leadership is one of the most effective ways to improve and grow a business. It is a key management function to increase efficiency and achieve the long-term and short-term vision for your organisation. Here are some key reasons why leadership is so important in business: Leaders motivate employees to take action through economic and non-economic rewards to incite action towards achieving the vision. Leadership initiates people. Through communication, vision and goal setting they are able to encourage people to take action. This is usually where leadership begins. Leaders are there for guidance. They dont just oversee that the work is done, they teach, nurture and guide people to encourage learning and personal growth. Leadership elicits coordination which ensures people are on path with the strategy that will achieve the goals and visions. This also ensures personal interests are aligned with organisation goals. Leaders set direction and this can result in increased confidence among employees. It can also increase satisfaction and reduce staff turnover as a result. Leadership drives improvement, growth and productivity within an organisation. Without effective leadership, divisions can often become fragmented or department goals do not align which causes tension that inhibits businesses reaching their full potential.What is the difference between leadership and management?Leadership and management are often used interchangeably, although there are some key differences in the roles . Both are important within a business model and both help to achieve goals, but they handle different aspects within the organisation.The first misconception around leadership and management is that when you move into a managerial role you automatically become a leader. This is not the case, as managers tend to handle things such as tasks - responsibilities around advertising, IT or equipment. While managers may lead a team, they are oriented on smaller goals rather than the big picture. To differentiate a leader in a management level role would require the individual to manage and lead people to achieve. The difference between goals and vision is also a major differentiator between leaders and managers. Leaders see the big picture and create the motion to transform that vision into reality by implementing a strategy that involves motivating people and teams, unifying departments towards a common goal. Managers, on the other hand, are focused on goals that are part of the larger plan.As comes naturally with the territory of leadership, those in such positions tend to take risks that managers do not. In fact, managers are focussed on mitigating risk and avoiding potential pitfalls. This flows into short-term and long-term focus. Managers are focused on the short-term while leaders are looking much further into the future. They remain motivated towards a larger end goal without requiring recognition.Another discerning difference between managers and leaders is that one is built around people and relationships, while the other structured around processes. Leaders motivate people to help them achieve their vision. They often use their skills of individualisation and empathy to connect with people. Managers instead implement structures and processes that support the achievement of the goals set by a leader.When it comes to inciting change and shaking things up, leaders are fit for the role. They are willing to push boundaries and innovate to create change, such as through redundancies , for the better. Managers instead aim to maintain processes that are working. They may refine systems but will not call for a complete overhaul.Another way to differentiate leadership from management is to evaluate their interactions with others. Leaders inspire people and have people who follow them. Those who follow in turn become advocates for the leader and what they are aiming to achieve. Managers instead direct people to achieve a particular goal. Those that work with the manager tend to follow directions and seek to please their managers.There is however a major overlap between the roles when it comes to leadership. Leaders must take on responsibility for managing. In a leadership role, there is always a need for management, however much of the work may be delegated to other team members who can ensure the task is carried out effectively. In contrast, managers are not expected to do the same. Management is a function that falls in the realm of good leadership skills. Managers can, however, develop their leadership skills to evolve into future leaders.What are the leadership skills and characteristics of a good manager?The characteristics of a good managerIts well-known that people leave managers, not companies but have you ever stopped to consider why? It's all too easy for managers to bury their heads in the sand when it comes to issues like employee engagement, rather than commit to tackling the issue head-on.But employee engagement is multi-faceted, so if employees are unhappy with their relationships at work, theyre far more likely to leave for greener pastures and its the responsibility of managers to prevent this from happening. Lets take a look at what it takes to be a good manager and crucially keep employees happy and engaged, with a real sense of ownership.The seven characteristics of a good managerFrom an employees perspective, a good manager can be summarised with seven key characteristics. Regular communication by setting performance expectations clearly, not just for employees, but also for whats required of management. Access to the right resources so employees have what they need to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities. Trust people to make the right decisions which frees them up to focus on what they do best. Recognise team members for their contributions and efforts. Establish a caring culture by making everybody feel theyre treated as an individual. Focus on value to help people feel like they meaningfully contribute to the company. Encourage employee opportunities to help them develop and grow.These characteristics are invaluable for quality management within an organisation. With employee engagement, such a large contributor to levels of staff turnover, understanding the qualities that good managers embody is instrumental for teams. It involves a cycle that can be toxic to businesses if not identified. Alternatively, those organisations which do encompass and nurture the desirable skills of a manager will reap the benefits and see the positive impact it can have on staff morale and engagement. The good news is that there are methods of improving leadership skills too.Thomas Engage: enhanced employee managementWe see promoting positive engagement as a win-win situation. When people have a positive attitude towards their role and organisation, theyre not only more productive and engaged, but theyll also be more likely to want to develop which is all beneficial for both your people and your company.To help us truly understand people as individuals and tailor the approach to employee engagement, we use the Thomas Engage model , where the strength and quality of relationships are measured using two important drivers: Togetherness  people feel valued as members of a group, and recognise that safety, trust, support, and cooperative relationships are high on the companys agenda. Voice  people feel accepted, their opinions are valued and acted upon, and their colleagues listen to and respect what they have to say. Simply, the process enables you to establish engagement levels in your organisation and identifies appropriate actions to help create effective and sustainable change.The must-haves for a great leaderPerhaps youre wondering how to improve leadership skills. Theres much debate on whether leaders are born or made but, whichever is the truth, effective leaders all have three traits in common.1. Emotional intelligence The difference between an acceptable leader and an exceptional one often lies in their capacity for emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify and manage your own emotions and the emotions of others around you. In recent years it has become noted for the high value it offers in the workplace and has been identified as one of the keys to being a great leader.But what is it about emotional intelligence thats so critical to effective leadership? Self-awareness Strong leaders can recognise their own emotions and the impact of these on others. They can also regulate their emotions as appropriate to the situation and react with logic rather than emotion when faced with a challenge or adversity. Motivation Effective leaders are self-motivated, committed to producing quality work, and strive to meet their own goals, and those of their team and company. Empathy To successfully guide other people, a leader must be empathetic, and understand what motivates or upsets them. Empathy gives leaders the ability to tune into the needs of others which develops better relationships. Sociability Leaders with great social skills are able to manage the emotions of others and navigate change or conflict. Theyre good networkers and can build strong relationships.Whats more, academic research demonstrates that high emotional intelligence is more prevalent in senior leaders with a long tenure meaning that experience plays a significant role in understanding the feelings and needs of others.Thomas's Emotional Intelligence assessment (TEIQue) can help your business understand employees emotions and how they approach the emotions of others in the workplace.2. TeamworkTo successfully grow a business and hit strategic goals, a leader needs to understand how to work effectively with others particularly other leaders. The essence of great teamwork for leaders is two-fold: understanding themselves and understanding each other.Leaders who have a good level of insight into how they and their team members behave and communicate including their strengths, limitations, and motivations have the tools to work effectively with their team. In addition, theyre aware of how to modify their behaviour to get the best out of those around them and can easily identify someones motivators.Strong leaders often practice a participative leadership style, involving their team in setting strategy and objectives. By empowering those around them to take ownership of company goals and strategy, they help to foster trust, creativity, and innovation.Cohesion is not only valuable in creating more engaged and empowered teams, but it also allows leaders to harness the strengths and attributes of other leaders - while there are common traits among effective leaders, they can also benefit from learning from their peers.3. AdaptabilityLeaders are often required to quickly adapt to organisational and business environment changes. Effective leadership means being able to adapt the strategy to new demands or situations this includes being open to new ideas or ways of working. The agility to pivot when required is fundamental to the success of leaders. Being able to adapt quickly, even if it is outside a leaders comfort zone enables them to remain at the forefront of cutting edge solutions and technology that can propel their organisation forward.Whats more, strong leaders are creative and think outside the box for ideas constantly looking for opportunities to innovate, and encouraging others to do so, too. Innovation is one of the greatest challenges to remain competitive. Great leaders will support creative thinking that generates new opportunities which can have a monumental impact, especially when it gives a business the upper hand.A critical component of strong leadership is the ability to remain calm, rational, and effective in the face of a changing or volatile environment. A report by the Boston Consulting Group and the National Association of Manufacturers , shows that some of these characteristics among others positively relate to people being innovative at work.Leaders that are adaptable and can respond to changing environments are able to: Ask questions and are committed to learning. Understand how they react to change and how to modify or regulate their reaction where necessary. Keep an open mind to new ways of doing things. Stay alert and attentive to where something may not be working.The profile of an effective senior leader by Ian MacRaeIan MacRae is Managing Director at High Potential Psychology Ltd and advisor to Thomas International.We all have opinions on what good leadership looks like. But what is it about a leaders personality that makes them so effective and inspiring in their role and, crucially, makes us form a positive opinion of their performance?Our Workplace Personality assessment (HPTI) helps identify leadership potential by exploring a person's personality traits and providing an indication of their potential for leadership.Its based on examples of individuals with proven track records of excellent performance in leadership to identify ideal levels of personality traits for senior roles.What does this look like in practice?A prime example of a successful leader is Lloyd Craig, former President and CEO of Coast Capital Savings, one of the largest credit unions in Canada.He joined the firm when it had 500 million in assets, and left with a market leading position with 12.9 billion in assets. Employees were engaged and happy to work there, and the company was regularly ranked as one of the best workplaces in Canada.Its why he was profiled in High Potential: How to Spot, Manage and Develop Talented People at Work , where Lloyd's motivation and values were explored including his relationship with long-term profitability and organisational success in the financial sector.But what about Lloyd makes him such an effective leader? Let's go through his HPTI scores to take a deeper dive into his personality.Conscientiousness score: 100 - Excessive Lloyd has the highest possible conscientiousness score, falling at the top end of excessive. Hes a perfectionist and is extraordinarily self-motivated. This is a good example of how excessiveness can potentially be a warning sign, but isnt inherently wrong. Lloyd can manage potential obsessive tendencies by being self-aware and channel his naturally excessive conscientiousness into productive endeavours. Its important for every leader to be aware of any potential issues their HPTI highlights, and equally vital to implement measures to mitigate more extreme tendencies.Adjustment score: 80 - OptimalThe ability to adjust is an important leadership quality. Lloyds score is well above average and within the optimal range. Hes good under pressure, isnt negatively affected by stress, and can handle significant workplace demand.Curiosity score: 65 - OptimalLloyd's curiosity is within the optimal range. Hes open to new approaches and is always looking for ways to improve the company, so much so that he introduced a suggestions scheme where every implemented idea was met with rewardRisk approach score: 95 - ExcessiveWhile he has a constructive approach to solving problems or conflicts as soon as they arise, Lloyd's risk approach score is high. Its not necessarily a bad attribute to have, but others may find it intimidating or confrontational. By combining this with his interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, Lloyd can mitigate any negative effects posed by his approach to risk.Ambiguity approach: 57 - Higher ModerateWhile above average, Lloyds ambiguity approach is still moderate. Hes good at using opinions and calling in experts to help him navigate a complex environment and role. His score isnt a problem in the grand scheme of things, but combined with his approach to risk, it may indicate a tendency to make quick decisions with little reflection.Competitiveness score: 77 - ExcessiveLloyd demonstrates excessive competitiveness. He wants to win, and he wants his company and team to be successful. But this shouldnt signal aggressive, overly competitive behaviours. Rather, in an industry that thrives of competition, this competitiveness was channelled into making his team and firm a success.Overall, Lloyd's results highlight how optimal zones should be used as a guideline, not arbitrary rules. And even though all six traits dont have optimal scores, its still a significant result to achieve. His score helps to provide important recommendations for leadership. To be a truly effective leader, you must: Develop talent based on core potential those with leadership potential need the opportunity to experience being ultimately accountable. Drive culture and values from the top leaders must embody the companys vision and demonstrate the right behaviours. Focus on shared vision and values and use diverse skills, traits, and attributes to your advantage. Be involved at every level of the company and gain valuable insight by making time to talk with all your employees. Take ultimate responsibility a leader needs to be accountable and aware; pressing people for additional information if needed.Leadership is about culture not just the bottom line The HPTI is designed to take a constructive approach to leadership. It helps to highlight how leadership is done not just bottom-line performance.Its not a cut-throat, manipulative, Machiavellian approach to leadership. Nor is it an approach that considers personal career gain more than company success.Simply, its a scientific programme that highlights high-potential individuals, and helps you to develop and retain leaders that can lead to tangible results.Establishing leadership potential using High Potential Trait IndicatorOne of the other defining features of the HPTI is its ability to identify optimal leadership traits. It goes beyond simply identifying personality traits and provides clear guidelines for identifying high potential leaders based on their personality traits. The HPTI ProcessGood scientific research involves thorough testing to build on theories by collecting large amounts of data. It can help to confirm findings and improve an understanding of a particular topic.Thomas International has tested and validated the HPTI with workers around the world to ensure its results and reports are valid, reliable, and useful in workplaces around the world.The HPTI is a scientifically validated tool, and a culture of continuous development helps it maintain relevance in a constantly changing business environment.Implications for businessHPTI personality traits are incredibly useful in assessing high potential at work for three key reasons:1. Personality is a stable and constant indicatorAs a consistent pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving, personality traits are relatively stable from early adulthood into later life. It means that personality is a very useful early indicator of potential at work.2. Personality is rooted in our brains and overall biologyPersonality comes from neurological processes and structures meaning its hardwired in the brain and very difficult to change. Unlike factors such as motivation which can often change personality is a useful predictor of long-term performance and potential.3. Personality traits interact and complement each otherPersonality traits dont exist in isolation. Each one interacts to form an overall personality structure. Having high or low levels of one particular trait will influence how all other traits are experienced and expressed. It means that getting a complete picture of an individuals traits working together is key to understanding overall leadership potential and decision making.Todays graduates, tomorrows leadersWith more graduates than ever achieving upper-second or first-class degrees , businesses can no longer rely on a candidates academic achievements as a sufficient differentiator.But how else can you ensure that youre hiring millenial talent with the potential to succeed in your organisation, and how can you develop them into the leaders of tomorrow?The answer is a graduate scheme backed by a rigorous, structured development programme. Graduate schemes come in all shapes and sizes, and span every major industry. Theyre a way for large organisations to bridge the gap between education and the world of work. Theyve also been proven to deliver long-term business benefits and have the potential to produce future leaders. So when nearly a quarter of the countrys leading employers are increasing their graduate recruitment budgets , there has never been a better opportunity to gain a competitive advantage. Heres how to make it happen.Recruit potential, not the finished productAlthough academic qualifications and CVs can give some idea about a candidates ability to fit into an organisation, they cant provide a reliable measure of workplace behaviour, cognitive ability , personality, future potential, or cultural fit. Its why more than three-quarters of HR professionals now agree that psychometrics is a powerful hiring tool.By understanding a candidates cognitive potential the speed at which they learn new information you can immediately compare different candidates and identify those more likely to hit the ground running and make an immediate impact on your organisation.When combined with a measure of behavioural , emotional , and personality traits, you create a powerful selection process that enables you to easily identify how well-matched a candidate is to a particular job role, graduate fast-track graduate programme, or leadership.Develop your new recruitsHaving the right development programme in place for high-potential graduates is as important as hiring the right people in the first place. And while youll have high expectations for your graduates, your graduates will have similarly high expectations of you as an employer.Its therefore critical to implement timely and comprehensive development to not only keep your employees engaged, but also foster their personal development.This can be done in several ways, including: Developing the key business skills required to succeed in your organisation and exposing them to different areas of your business. Conducting team behavioural profiling to gain a deeper understanding of their preferred ways of working and learning environments, and to encourage team working and improve communication. Holding regular soft-skills training courses that help build and develop certain personality traits and behaviours. Delivering regular constructive feedback based on their performance across your entire organisation.By producing a structured development programme, you can ensure that everyone has access to the same knowledge and opportunities that support progression and enhance performance.Identify your future leadersYouve hired high-potential graduates and spent a year developing their hard skills, behaviours, and business acumen so whats next?Benchmarking enables you to audit your potential leaders and helps you to identify commonalities between high-potential traits and performance across your entire organisation.This, combined with appraisal grading and nine-box grid evaluations, will help you to pick out those most likely to succeed as future leaders, and signal next best steps. You may then want to offer leadership skills and communication training, focused on developing their ability to perform as a leader. As with all graduates, development should be continuous and tailored to the individual ensuring you provide each employee with the best opportunity to perform.Self-development and the steps towards stronger leadershipSuccessful leaders know theres always room for improvement and make time for self-development no matter how senior they are.To help maintain progression and direction, weve identified four key steps to follow that can help support continuous growth as part of the self-improvement process.1. Decide on your objectivesWithout understanding where and who you want to be, youll struggle to focus your development.Thats why its a good idea to write down all your goals and aspirations no matter how outlandish they may seem to help develop a complete picture of your objectives, regardless of whether theyre achievable in the short term.Also think about who you want to be in an ideal world. Ask yourself two questions: Are there certain behaviours you feel you need to work on to become a better leader? Do you want to develop elements of your emotional intelligence, for example to become more optimistic, or to have more control over your impulses?2. Gain a clear picture of your current situationThe next step is to create a clear picture of who and where you are now including your strengths and weaknesses. Its important to consider both your behaviours and personality traits, as well as your hard skills.Like we highlighted in the previous section, psychometric assessments can help you understand your personality, behaviour, and emotional intelligence to help identify where your strengths lie, and what skills and attributes you may need to develop.Whats more, constructive feedback from your colleagues and customers about your strengths and weaknesses will help add objectivity.Once youve identified your strengths and weaknesses, its important to bring it all together. A SWOT matrix can be useful to display your strengths and weaknesses alongside any opportunities and threats, and will make it easier to identify self-development actions you need to take.3. Plan your strategyOnce youve identified where you are now and where you want to be, you need to bridge that gap to make your leadership vision a reality.The first step is setting objectives. We recommend following the SMART framework:Once you know exactly what you want to achieve, you now need to put your plan into action. Ask yourself what training you may require and what support you need. Would you benefit from coaching, or the wisdom of an experienced mentor?If you act early on and keep the momentum going long-term, youre more likely to develop as a leader.4. Reflect and reviewThe environment around you is constantly changing, so taking an approach of continuous evaluation is key to ensure your plan doesnt drift. Review your progress against your objectives monthly and be prepared to amend your goals and action plan along the way.Its also important to collect feedback at least once a year to objectively assess your strengths and weaknesses, and understand if these change over time.Your leadership questions answeredAt Thomas International, we help organisations like yours find the best leaders today, and develop them for your challenges tomorrow. Weve based this section on questions you may be asking right now, and weve provided some guidance below.1. What are the four types of leadership? Autocratic centralises power and decision making, gives orders, assigns task and duties without consulting employees and takesassumes full authority Democraticparticipative decentralise authority. Characterised by consultation and participation in the formulation of plans. Encourages participation in decision making. Laissez-faire Also known as free-rein leadership. These leaders avoid power and responsibility, gives no direction and allows the group to establish their own goals and work out their own problems. Paternalistic relationship between the leader and the group is the same as the relationship between the head of the family and members of the family. The leader guides and protects his subordinates as members of his family.2. What are the seven functions of leadership?The seven functions of leadership are the seven main managerial functions that a leader needs to do. These are: Planning Organising Leading Controlling Staffing Motivating Directing3. What are the most important skills a leader should have?According to Professor Adrian Furnham, who co-developed the HPTI assessment, the top three most important skills a leader should have are: The ability to form and maintain healthy relationships Self-awareness aware of their own strengths and limitations The ability to embrace changeDave Woodward, former CEO for H.J. Heinz Company, believes that overall intelligence is one of the key skills a leader should have. By overall intelligence, this includes emotional intelligence, spiritual intelligence and a healthy IQ.Conclusion: Harvest and develop todays leaders for a brighter tomorrowWhether leadership is something people are born with or a learnt skill, being able to identify leaders using a scientific approach and supporting their continuous development is vitally important for any successful and competitive organisation.At Thomas International, we use scientifically proven processes such as HPTI to help organisations like yours tackle the challenges of identifying, recruiting, and retaining leaders both today and tomorrow.To see how we can help you harvest and develop the best leaders your industry has to offer and if you have any questions that arent covered here, get in touch with one of our experts .Please select which Thomas product you would like to sign in toAre you a candidate?

    "plain_text": "Pages: 10 Page 1: Free Sample Psychometric Test Questions Answers (2026) Free Psychometric Test Sample Questions and AnswersPsychometric tests are a type of assessment commonly used during the hiring process. They explore the cognitive ability or personality characteristics of candidates, to measure their suitability for a role.Psychometric tests come in many forms and styles, each measuring a specific skill or aptitude. They are broadly separated into two categories: Aptitude tests, which explore a candidates reasoning orcognitive ability. Common aptitude tests include numerical reasoning, verbal reasoning, inductive reasoning and abstract reasoning. Personality tests: these assess a candidates behaviours, drives, motivations and values to determine how well they fit the company and role.As you typically do not need to learn any new information before taking a psychometric test, you cant revise for them as such. But practicing sample tests will help improve your scores by familiarising you with the format and style of the questions.Have a go at our free sample psychometric questions below, and remember to check your answers with the solutions and explanations at the end of the page.Sample numerical reasoning test questionWhat was the total value of Grade A and C wireless headphones produced in 2019? 490,000 540,000 550,000 790,000Sample abstract reasoning test questionWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence?Sample verbal reasoning test questionStatement: Therapists have some flexibility regarding what they deem serious enough to lead them to breach confidentiality. True False Cannot tellSample inductive reasoning test questionWhich completes the sequence?Sample spatial awareness test questionWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence?Answers SolutionsSample numerical reasoning test question Find the number of wireless headphones produced in 2019. Divide the number produced by 50 (the headphones are sold in batches of 50). Multiply this number (i.e. the number of batches) by the cost per batch. You need to do a separate calculation as each grade of headphone costs a different amount:Grade A 2019 25,000 50 x 500 250,000Grade C 2019 80,000 50 x 150 240,000Total 250,000 240,000 490,000Sample abstract reasoning test questionSolution: The circle is in the bottom-left every three turns, and the triangle is present in every two turns. Therefore, the box should not have a circle or triangle inside it.Sample verbal reasoning test questionSolution: In the last sentence, it mentions how individual employers and independent therapists have their own boundaries and must agree this contractually with their client at the outset of their therapeutic relationship. Therefore, therapists do have some flexibility regarding what they deem serious enough to breach confidentiality.Sample inductive reasoning test questionSolution: The number of sides of each shape is decreasing by 2 each time you move along. The previous shape has 6 sides, so the missing shape must have 4 sides.Sample spatial awareness test question Solution: The large square overlays the small square with every two turns. The triangle moves from the top-left corner to the top-right corner with every turn. Therefore, there should be no large square, and the triangle should be in the top-right corner.Further practiceIf you want to try a full free practice test for any of the above test types, click on the links below:Numerical reasoning testsAbstract reasoning testsVerbal reasoning testsInductive reasoning testsSpatial awareness testsAlternatively, if youre looking for tips on how to do well in psychometric tests generally, check out our 10 tips to pass psychometric tests and 10 ways to prepare for a psychometric test .Do you want toImprove by 42?If you're really serious about getting a top job, then your first step is to master psychometric tests.

Either way, our tips for passing these tests should help you increase your scores.Psychometric tests take various forms depending on the role and provider. Common test types include numerical reasoning , mechanical aptitude , logical reasoning and verbal reasoning . They are almost always taken online.One of the key differences between aptitude tests and academic exams is that you are not being tested on your knowledge; rather how you think and react.While you cannot revise as such because there is nothing to learn, there are lots of areas you can focus on to improve your chances of scoring highly when it matters. Weve split our tips into two sections below: general advice, and tips for individual test types.General psychometric test tips1) Practise realistic online testsMost psychometric tests are carried out online via your computer, so you should try to use practice tests that mimic those you will encounter (ie digital mock assessments are to be preferred over a book or ebook).The various test providers also have different styles: some will ask you to interpret data and then select a multiple-choice answer; others might ask you to play an online game. Make sure youre familiar with all the test publishers (see tip 6).2) Identify and work on your weakest areasAs you practice and get results, youll be able to see which areas you tend to struggle with. Keep a note of the questions that you find hardest, and then practice more of those questions.For example, you might find that you are struggling with verbal reasoning questions that have long paragraphs of text. Here, you could practice reading longer news articles at speed and then writing down all the salient points.Many find numerical reasoning tests the most challenging; if thats the case for you, check out our article on numerical test tips .3) Get performance feedbackIf you have taken psychometric tests before and didnt progress to the next application stage, dont forget to ask for feedback. It might be that you simply didnt carry out the test quickly enough, or didnt read the answers thoroughly and made poor assumptions.All of these issues can be worked through with practice and preparation, but only if you know what the issues are.4) Check all your technology is working wellMake sure that you are not hampered by a slow laptop or a poor internet connection. Also, ensure you know how to pause notifications and calls on your device, so that when you do take the tests you are not interrupted.Have a back-up plan should, for example, your broadband not be working well on the day that you are due to take the test. 5) Broaden your knowledge and vocabularyParticularly relevant for verbal reasoning , though it applies across the spectrum of tests. Spend time familiarising yourself with the skill of reading and understanding information that isnt in your normal sphere.Read different newspapers and academic texts. This will help broaden your vocabulary, which can aid with quicker comprehension .Individual test tipsOnce you have been invited to take a psychometric assessment for a specific company, try these tips to help you with your preparation.6) Find out the tests the employer is likely to useThere are many different test providers with varying formats. The recruiter may specify which type of test provider they use, or you may be able to ascertain the information from their website. You can also consult our list of company tests for further details.Once you have this information you can spend more time practising that specific style of test, so that you are familiar with the length and format, as well as the speed that you need to work through the questions.7) Ascertain what the employer is looking forEnsure youre confident as to what attributes the employer is seeking in their perfect candidate. You might be able to pick up clues in the job description for example, if the word ambitious is mentioned, they may favour employees with a behaviour profile weighted towards risk-taking.You can also make enquiries with others who have gone through the process as to whether they have any advice to pass on. Check Student Room and Glassdoor, and ask among your peers.8) Check what tools are allowed and know how to use themMake sure that you are prepared in terms of the rules of the test. Some tests let you use a calculator; for those, have one to hand and know how to work any relevant functions.For any maths-based test where you arent allowed one, have paper and pencil to hand, and learn how to calculate basic functions such as adding percentages .9) Check the timings and know when you need to move onMost psychometric tests are timed, and this is usually taken into account when assessing each candidate. Remember that each question is either right or wrong (there are no marks for the way you achieve each question). As such, sometimes youll need to prioritise time taken over getting the correct answer.You may find that you are provided with a rough time guide and a suggestion of how many questions will be asked. If so, calculate how long you have per question and stick to it.10) Dont rush reading the data for each questionThat said, ensure that you have actually understood what each question is asking you without leaping to assumptions. It can be easy to select the wrong answer too quickly, particularly in the kind of question that is designed to catch you out.Welcome to Practice Aptitude Tests Our platform is packed full of tests, tips, articles and videos which we're excited to share with you.

Personality tests: these assess a candidates behaviours, drives, motivations and values to determine how well they fit the company and role.As you typically do not need to learn any new information before taking a psychometric test, you cant revise for them as such. But practicing sample tests will help improve your scores by familiarising you with the format and style of the questions.Have a go at our free sample psychometric questions below, and remember to check your answers with the solutions and explanations at the end of the page.Sample numerical reasoning test questionWhat was the total value of Grade A and C wireless headphones produced in 2019? 490,000 540,000 550,000 790,000Sample abstract reasoning test questionWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence?Sample verbal reasoning test questionStatement: Therapists have some flexibility regarding what they deem serious enough to lead them to breach confidentiality. True False Cannot tellSample inductive reasoning test questionWhich completes the sequence?Sample spatial awareness test questionWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence?Answers SolutionsSample numerical reasoning test question Find the number of wireless headphones produced in 2019. Divide the number produced by 50 (the headphones are sold in batches of 50). Multiply this number (i.e. the number of batches) by the cost per batch. You need to do a separate calculation as each grade of headphone costs a different amount:Grade A 2019 25,000 50 x 500 250,000Grade C 2019 80,000 50 x 150 240,000Total 250,000 240,000 490,000Sample abstract reasoning test questionSolution: The circle is in the bottom-left every three turns, and the triangle is present in every two turns. Therefore, the box should not have a circle or triangle inside it.Sample verbal reasoning test questionSolution: In the last sentence, it mentions how individual employers and independent therapists have their own boundaries and must agree this contractually with their client at the outset of their therapeutic relationship. Therefore, therapists do have some flexibility regarding what they deem serious enough to breach confidentiality.Sample inductive reasoning test questionSolution: The number of sides of each shape is decreasing by 2 each time you move along. The previous shape has 6 sides, so the missing shape must have 4 sides.Sample spatial awareness test question Solution: The large square overlays the small square with every two turns. The triangle moves from the top-left corner to the top-right corner with every turn. Therefore, there should be no large square, and the triangle should be in the top-right corner.Further practiceIf you want to try a full free practice test for any of the above test types, click on the links below:Numerical reasoning testsAbstract reasoning testsVerbal reasoning testsInductive reasoning testsSpatial awareness testsAlternatively, if youre looking for tips on how to do well in psychometric tests generally, check out our 10 tips to pass psychometric tests and 10 ways to prepare for a psychometric test .Do you want toImprove by 42?If you're really serious about getting a top job, then your first step is to master psychometric tests.

These challenging assessments help to indicate which candidates in the cohort possess the mental agility to perform well under pressure.Achieving the best results possible is important as, in a competitive job market, often only the top 10 of candidates progress to the next stage of the application process.The question types and overall test structure will vary according to which psychometric test you are required to sit, but there are preparation factors that apply across all psychometric test types .To ensure you are adequately prepared and perform to the highest standard come the day of your test, consider our list of the ten most common mistakes below and how to avoid them.1) Inadequate question practiceAptitude test questions can be tricky without preparation. The questions often contain superfluous information or answer options that are intentionally misleading.Adequate practice with mock psychometric test questions will help improve both your confidence and ability.2) Lack of research on test type and publisherNot all psychometric tests are created equal, as their demands vary according to the publisher. For example, while most psychometric tests have challenging time limits, Cappfinity tests have no time restriction.Seek to find out as much as you can about the aptitude test you will be sitting, so you can tailor your practice accordingly and use the most accurate material. If test type or publisher information is not initially given, enquire with your prospective employer.Practice Aptitude Tests has psychometric test questions organised by test type , industry , employer and publisher , to help with targeted preparation.3) Not sticking to timings when taking the testTo secure a top test score, you must answer accurately and rapidly. Take heed of the timings you will be faced with and practice to the same time limit, so you become used to the pace required to complete the test.It may be tempting to spend longer on questions you find tricky, but it is unwise to exceed the time allotted. For example, if you are sitting an SHL numerical reasoning test and have 20 minutes to answer 20 questions, keep to 1 minute per question. Once the minute is up, select an answer and move straight on to the next question.You can always return to review questions at the end if you have time. If you intend to come back to a question, note down its number for ease of reference later.4) Getting others to help you during the testInitial stage psychometric assessments are most often taken online at home. This means the tests are not policed, so technically there is scope for candidates to enlist assistance from friends or family. This is foolish on two fronts. Psychometric tests are often taken under timed conditions, so there is little time to consult with others or become distracted from your thought process. Working in this way you will likely not answer enough questions to pass the assessment.Employers also commonly require psychometric tests to be retaken at a later stage in the recruitment process to verify your scores. Trust in your own ability and prepare properly.5) Getting insufficient sleep the night before the testPsychometric tests require clear, logical thinking and rapid problem solving. With lack of sleep, your brain will not be able to function to the best of its ability.As achieving the highest score possible gives you the best chance of moving to the next stage in the recruitment process, ensure you get at least eight hours of sleep. It is also wise if you are taking the test at home and can choose when you complete it to sit your test at the time of day you feel most refreshed and alert.6) Not reading the questions properly before answeringWhilst you will likely need to stick to a fast pace to complete the test in the allotted time, you must not rush. Racing through the test, without paying attention to the detail, will not result in accurate answers.Psychometric test questions often contain distractors, which are pieces of information that are irrelevant and included to mislead. Approaching each question calmly, having read and processed the information given to identify the salient parts, is the best way to reach the correct answer.7) Failing to focus your revision time on your weakest areasWhen preparing to sit your psychometric test, it is important to practice with question material similar to the real assessment and then to take the time to review your results. Looking over your practice tests will help you to identify your strengths and weaknesses, and track your progress across different topic areas.Although it is tempting to revise topics in which you are more confident and can achieve a good confidence-boosting score, to perform well overall you will need to spend time focusing upon building your ability in your weakest areas.8) Failing to read the test instructions carefullyDo not assume you know the exact format of the test because you have taken multiple practice tests, as assessment styles can vary according to publisher (and even between iterations of test material produced by the same provider).Check the time allocated for the test and the number of questions included are as expected (and make any adjustments to pace necessary if they are not). Read through the instructions for each section of the test, paying close attention to how your answers should be logged.The instructions may also contain handy tips or even an example question. Ensure you take the help provided to you by reading all available information.9) Not having the correct materials for the test Whether you are sitting the test at home or at a test centre, it will likely be up to you to ensure you have the materials you need to sit the test. For example if you are sitting a numerical reasoning test, make sure you have a scientific calculator that can perform all the functions you may require.You do not have to hold all the information in your head when answering questions, as you can use rough paper and a pencil to jot down any workings. It is easy to overlook this aid when completing digitised tests.As the tests are administered online, if you are taking the test at home you will need a computer with a recently updated browser and a stable internet connection. This will allow the assessment questions to load smoothly and avoid any technical issues.10) Not reviewing multiple-choice answer optionsMultiple-choice answers are a common feature of most psychometric tests. The best method of approaching them depends on the type of test and your personal preference but, as a general rule, it is better to start with the question and work to the answer rather than working backwards from several answers.While its not wise to dwell upon each potential answer before beginning your own independent thought process, glancing at the potential answers before starting to solve the problem is sensible. If you have an awareness of the answer list, it will help you to quickly judge if your workings are leading you in the right direction.Welcome to Practice Aptitude TestsOur platform is packed full of tests, tips, articles and videos which we're excited to share with you.

If taking your test online, make sure youll have no interruptions, and double-check your internet connection for stability.2Digest the practice questions in the real testMost numerical reasoning tests start with a couple of practice questions to get you warmed up. Study these carefully and make note of structure, content and style. Theyll give you a good indication of whats to come and get you in the right frame of mind.3Pay close attention to detailThe easiest way to slip up on your test is to misinterpret the question. You may be working against the clock but dont let that stop you from taking the time to understand what is being asked. Read each question carefully to avoid silly mistakes.4Work with what you've been givenEach question will include all the information you need to draw the right conclusion, so dont make assumptions about the data. Just work with whats in front of you.5Don't dwell on difficult questionsRemember, youre working on a time limit, so if you find yourself stuck, move on. Often, the more you struggle with a complex problem, the more confused you become. You can always come back for another go if you have time to spare at the end.6Take an educated guessWhere you are unsure of the answer, use a process of elimination to narrow down your options. An unanswered question will score you nothing. An educated guess may well prove correct.7Beware of red herringsAs mentioned, multiple-choice options in numerical reasoning tests can often include distractors, and questions can include irrelevant information designed to put you off track. Keep your wits about you, double-check your answers for accuracy, and focus only on the information you need.8Double-check what you're working withSome questions may require you to work with varying units of measurement, multiple currencies, or different number representations. Make sure youre using the right information in the right way to draw your conclusions.9Pace yourselfAlthough its important not to let it become a distraction, you need to be aware of timing. As a rule of thumb, one question every minute is a steady pace, though some tests will allow more, and some less. Practice is essential here, so be sure to include pacing as part of your test preparation.10Stay calm and focused Numerical reasoning tests require fixed concentration, so shut yourself off from whatever surrounds you. Though its easier said than done for some, try not to let the pressure get to you, and keep a cool head thats zoned in on the task at hand.Numerical Reasoning Video TutorialsGraph InterpretationNumerical Tests: A GuidePercentage ChangePrepare for your Numerical Reasoning AssessmentsImmediate access.

Raw score is when all your correct answers are summarized and displayed in percentage ratio. Comparative score is when your results are compared to the results of other people who took the test in your group.Where will I take my numerical reasoning test?Depending on the employer, you may be asked to take your numerical reasoning test online, or in person at an assessment centre. If online, it may also be the case that youre required to sit a second test in person as an anti-cheat precaution.When should I expect my results?Unfortunately, theres no answer to this. It will vary between employers. If youre unsuccessful in progressing to the next stage, you may not even receive your results at all. Where this is the case, you can always try contacting the HR department for feedback on your assessment. This can help you improve in future tests.What's more important  speed or accuracy?Ideally you want a fine balance between the two. The more questions you answer, the higher your score, but only if you get them right. Dont take chances, and dont let the time pressure get to you. Ultimately, practice is more important than either, since this is the best way to ensure you can work both quickly and correctly.Can you use a calculator in numerical reasoning tests?In most cases, yes, youll be able to use a calculator, and we recommend using one that youre familiar with. However, this might not always be possible. There are some numerical assessment tests that dont allow them at all, and others where, if taking the test in person, youll be given a standard issue calculator at the assessment centre. Every test will have different rules, so if you can, check this information beforehand.Why are numerical reasoning tests so hard?Numerical reasoning tests are hard to ensure that theres a nice spread of results for employers to gain a strong understanding of their candidates analytical abilities. On top of this, some numerical reasoning tests are purposefully written to be difficult to reveal how candidates perform under pressure.Where can I practice numerical reasoning tests? There are many general practice tests available online, as well as publisher specific tests from the providers themselves, including those mentioned above. Some of these are free to use, some are paid for services that offer additional support. You can also use our own resources. We have a range of free aptitude tests to help you prepare for whatever type of assessment you may be facing.Can I get help if taking my test online?Having someone to help you with your numerical reasoning test is not a good idea and getting someone to take it for you should be avoided at all costs.

Artificial intelligence techniques and machine learning solutions elevate test quality and accuracy. It can adapt to changing contexts and needs and provide relevant insights. Assessment providers employ new data sources, such as demographic information, previous job performance traces, and cultural fitment, to generate a holistic report of the test takers.Current evolutions Some emerging issues and trends in psychometrics include cross-cultural validity, data-driven approaches, and artificial intelligence. Cross-cultural validity is the extent to which an assessment is suitable and meaningful for various cultural groups and the methods for ensuring and enhancing it, such as translation, adaptation, and alignment.Types of psychometric assessmentsSome of the psychometric assessment examples are-Personality testsPersonality tests are psychometric assessments that identify specific personality traits required to perform a job role. These tests offer significant insights into a candidates essential qualities, motivations, behavioral styles, etc.The science behind testing personalityPersonality tests usually follow two significant schools of thought: trait-based and type approaches. While the type theory categorizes personalities into introverted and extroverted, the trait theory measures the degree to which key personality traits exist in an individual. The type theory defines individuals as introverts or extroverts in varying intensities.Examples of models that follow the type theory are: Enneagram of personality:An enneagram recognizes nine enneatypes or interconnected personality types. A geometric shape known as an enneagram represents these interconnections based on various aspects of intelligence. It predicts behavior patterns, emotional intelligence, and the ability to build professional and personal relationships. DISC profile: This method analyses personalities based on dominance, influence, steadiness and conscientiousness. Instead of testing for aptitude, intelligence, or values, the DISC profile focuses on an individuals reactions, impact, and speed in challenging situations. The most significant drawback of the DISC profile is its failure to assess specific personality traits that may be essential to succeed in a job. The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI): MBTI groups personalities into 16 significant types with varying combinations of introversion or extraversion. The 16 types contain abbreviations of four letters each, denoting fundamental dynamics. For example, ESTJ consists of extraversion, sensing, thinking, and judgment, and INFP consists of introversion, intuition, feeling, and perception.Trait-focused personality assessments are all based on the Big Five Factor or the OCEAN model. Developed in the 1970s, this model enlists five major personality traits among humans in varying degrees. A psychometric assessment measures the level of these traits through a series of questions and problem-solving exercises. Openness:Individuals possessing this trait have a natural penchant for adventure and art. They are curious, creative, and open to change. Conscientiousness:Highly conscientious people are organized and have a sense of responsibility. They have the drive to achieve their goals and are highly reliable. This trait has shown marked achievement on the job. Extraversion:Individuals who possess extraversion indicate various characteristics, including sociability and talkativeness. They draw their energy from day-to-day social interactions or gatherings. Such individuals are primarily cheerful and assertive in their approach. Agreeableness:Agreeableness is indicative of a persons kindness. Such individuals are trusting and helpful. Neuroticism:Individuals possessing this trait worry a lot and often find themselves feeling depressed and anxious. On the contrary, people low on neuroticism are emotionally stable and exhibit calmness and composure when facing problems. Personality tests gather information about an individual to make inferences about personal characteristics. These include feelings, behaviors, or thoughts. They help measure aspects of personality that determine, or are predictive of, successful performance at work, thinking style, workplace relationships, task management, feelings, and motivation.Cognitive ability testsCognitive ability tests, also known as aptitude tests , evaluate the mental abilities of individuals. They measure an individuals critical thinking , logical reasoning , verbal ability and problem-solving skills . They also assess how individuals use past experiences in novel situations.The science behind testing cognitive abilityCognitive ability tests measure two essential components of human intelligence: fluid and crystallized. While fluid intelligence includes reasoning, crystallized intelligence revolves around facts and information acquired via experiences. Considering these aspects of intelligence, recruiters may find it challenging to assess and select candidates objectively.When to use cognitive ability tests?The test is used when companies need a filtration method to assess a large candidate pool or when recruiters need to add an extra layer of assessment to identify the top talent from a group of equally efficient professionals.Cognitive tests like verbal comprehension, numerical ability, critical thinking, and problem-solving cater to more niche job roles.

Cognitive ability tests evaluate individuals mental capabilities by measuring critical thinking, logical reasoning, verbal skills, and problem-solving abilities. These tests also assess how individuals apply their past experiences to new situations. Personality tests provide insights into an applicants behavioral styles and motivations by identifying the required qualities for a job.These tests have numerous uses, such as predicting job performance and cultural fit. They identify strengths, areas of improvement, and preferences, and aid in potential goal setting, creating development plans, giving feedback, and setting rewards. They offer valuable insights on job satisfaction, future progression, and employee engagement. In addition, psychometric tests identify high-potential employees, helping create succession plans and clarifying role attributes.Technological advancements shaping the future Integrating AI and machine learning into psychometric assessments can be a transformative leap in measuring human behavior and psychological traits. It enhances traditional assessment tools accuracy and efficiency and allows nuanced and individualized interpretations.

Companies are also gradually utilizing AR and VR in onboarding through virtual job fairs, assessment centers and office tours, attracting candidates and acclimatizing new hires to the company culture. These technologies offer numerous benefits, with a sense of immersion and presence that traditional methods cannot provide.Evolving methodologiesAdaptive testing refers to adjusting the assessment based on the candidates abilities. It means selecting questions for candidates according to their scores on earlier questions to enhance the accuracy of measuring their skill level.

The candidates ability level gradually stabilizes, leading to a final test result. This approach has several notable advantages: the time required to evaluate a candidates ability can be reduced by up to 50, leading to quicker assessments. Additionally, candidates are often more motivated since they are not faced with excessively difficult or too easy questions. Furthermore, the test can assess a wide array of skills.Some of the future trends in personalized assessments will include authentic experiences.

These assessments modify the original form of traditional evaluations by adding game elements to increase motivation. They are highly effective as they prioritize the candidates experience in the recruitment process. When candidates view a selection process positively, it can result in fewer withdrawals from the hiring process and an increased likelihood of job acceptance. These tests offer an accurate assessment of role competencies and a practical platform for candidates to showcase their skills in real-time.For example, a gamified coding assessment can provide candidates with challenges that mirror real job scenarios. By tackling these challenges in a game format, candidates can showcase their coding skills, problem-solving capabilities, and creativity. This method gives hiring managers evidence of a candidates abilities with its interactive assessment nature for collecting detailed performance metrics, such as completion time, accuracy, and decision-making patterns.The gamification market is expected to grow to US76.3 billion by 2030, driven by its increasing adoption in various business sectors.Ethical considerations and challengesThe growing use of psychometric testing across various fields raises important data privacy issues that organizations must address. As they collect and analyze sensitive personal data, the risk of unauthorized access and possible misuse increases, threatening individuals rights and well-being. To ensure unbiased and inclusive testing, stakeholders, including employers, test administrators, and policymakers, must establish strong data protection measures, follow ethical guidelines, and promote transparency in the testing process.This proactive strategy will ensure compliance with data privacy laws, leading to a more responsible and ethical application of psychometric assessments. Transparency and explainability are crucial in AI-driven psychometric assessments. Candidates have the right to understand how their data is used and how the assessment process works. Clear and accessible explanations of how AI algorithms are used, the criteria they evaluate, and the implications of the assessment results can help ensure transparency and mitigate concerns about AI.Implications for organizations and individualsOrganizations can leverage psychometric testing into their HR strategies for improved hiring and employee development. These assessments help employers customize development programs to match their workforces strengths and areas of improvement. Understanding employees psychological profiles allows organizations to create tailored training that boosts performance, engagement, and job satisfaction, leading to a more productive workplace. Moreover, psychometric testing aids succession planning and talent management by identifying high-potential employees and assessing their readiness for leadership roles. It allows employees to become responsible for their career growth and helps organizations build a strong talent pipeline.In todays competitive landscape, using psychometric assessments strategically provides a significant advantage, aligning individual capabilities with organizational goals.

It presents an objective assessment of an individuals capabilities, character, skills, and drive compared to their counterparts based on multiple criteria. Incorporating these tests contributes to developing a thorough profile of individuals, allowing for an impartial evaluation of their future performance and suitability for specific roles. Organizations must employ valid (i.e., assess what they assert to assess) and reliable (i.e., uniformity in evaluation) psychometric instruments to realize the best outcomes.But how can psychometrics provide a positive return on investment? This detailed blog will uncover the remarkable potential of psychometrics in delivering substantial ROI for organizations across various sizes and industries.Unlocking positive ROI with psychometric testingPsychometric testing can be decisive in organizational decision-making, specifically talent management. Yet, the crucial question that many organizations pose is whether investing in psychometrics yields a tangible return on investment. This analysis is relevant and essential in justifying the resources allocated to these evaluations and their overall influence on organizational success. One of the key merits of psychometric testing is its ability to enhance the recruitment process. Time-honored hiring methods, often based on resume screening and interviews, have constraints in reliably predicting an individuals future job performance. In contrast, psychometric solutions offer actionable insights into a persons cognitive abilities, personality traits, and other relevant characteristics. These insights enable companies to make well-thought-out hiring decisions and identify talent whose skills match the job requirements and the organizations values and culture. This, in turn, contributes to a reduced attrition rate and ensures a better job-candidate fit, which helps businesses reduce recruitment costs and improve productivity.Besides, psychometric testing broadens its influence beyond the ambit of hiring, significantly contributing to improving team dynamics and overall team performance. Acquiring insights into the team members psychological profiles enables managers to assemble teams with complementary strengths and weaknesses. This team diversity can lead to better issue resolution, enhanced cooperation, and amplified productivity. Moreover, these assessment instruments can pinpoint areas where employees may benefit from further skill development or betterment, driving professional growth that offers long-term advantages.Psychometric testing also has a vital role in facilitating leadership development initiatives. Recognizing high-potential individuals internally through these assessments and allocating personalized development plans can lead to a more capable leadership pipeline. Capable leaders act as an enabler of organizational success, and commitment to leadership development can increase employee engagement, reduce attrition among top talent, and enhance organizational performance.Another notable benefit of psychometric testing centers on promoting employee engagement and satisfaction. When employees gain self-awareness through psychometric profiling and better understand themselves and their peers, it fosters a supportive and compassion-driven work setting. Hence, it can increase job satisfaction, better self-understanding, and decrease stress levels. Satisfied and motivated employees are inclined to demonstrate more remarkable dedication to their work, positively impacting organizational performance and productivity.The benefits of psychometric testing are beyond doubt when it comes to unlocking ROI for organizations. By optimizing hiring processes, improving team dynamics, bolstering leadership development, and promoting employee engagement, psychometric solutions have proven vital in reducing hiring costs, maximizing productivity, and enhancing the companys performance. As businesses continue to acknowledge the value of psychometrics in the modern workplace, their investment in psychometric testing solutions is likely to continue generating positive ROI.Exploring the relationship between test validity and return on investment (ROI)In simple terms, test validity refers to how accurately the test measures what it asserts to measure. And return on investment refers to receiving a greater return than an initial investment, such as when someone invests money in a business and reaps the best returns. The association between test validity and ROI is a critical factor in the areas of talent management and human resources, and it is evident in several ways:Successful hiring decisions: High validity of a test ensures that the test questions are strongly aligned with the core focus of the assessment. Valid and reliable assessments help organizations make informed hiring choices by identifying well-suited candidates. When employees are perfectly aligned to their roles, they execute their responsibilities effectively and efficiently, increasing productivity and minimizing turnover. Therefore, it adds to a positive ROI as the organization gains from a more productive and steadfast workforce.Lowered training expenses:Valid tests help pinpoint employees' exact training and development needs, ensuring that their specific needs are addressed. Organizations can make the most of their training investments by administering psychometric assessments and tailoring training and development programs in line with the assessment data to understand employees' training needs. When the training is on point, it improves employee performance, which can directly add to ROI.Predictive analytics with psychometrics:Valid psychometric tests offer crucial insights that organizations can leverage for predictive analytics. For example, personality tests can project which employees are better poised to succeed in leadership roles. By using such actionable insights to make rational choices, organizations can methodically assign resources and investments where they are expected to generate a positive ROI.To sum up, valid assessments allow businesses to make data-driven decisions that contribute to improved employee performance, better employee engagement, and enhanced productivity all of which translate to a favorable ROI. When companies place a premium on the validity of their psychometric testing tools and use them strategically, they can capitalize on the maximum potential of their human capital and achieve promising returns on their talent management initiatives.Calculating the ROI of psychometric testingEvaluating the ROI linked to psychometric testing is essential to validate its impact on the overall financial performance (i.e., the companys bottom line). Calculating the ROI of psychometric testing entails gauging the financial benefits of using these assessments against the cost of implementing these tools.While it may seem challenging to quantify the impact of testing, it is critical for firms looking to utilize such insights to streamline their talent management strategies. One should consider the benefits and costs evident in the implementation process to calculate ROI. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the process:Return on investment is equivalent to the progress report of investments. It determines whether a particular investment is profitable or not.If the ROI is positive, an investment results in a net gain in financial returns compared to its initial cost. If it is negative, it means financial losses incurred due to the investment. ROI calculation speaks volumes about an investments profitability- be it a new business venture or even something as indispensable as psychometric tests for a company.Fundamental considerations prior to ROI assessmentIdentify costs:First and foremost, it is essential to identify all the costs concerning implementing psychometric tests. These costs may include the purchase of a psychometric testing provider, staff training costs, set up and customization costs, report interpretation, consultation costs, etc.Quantify gains: The next step would be to determine the benefits contingent on the underlying business objectives that impact an organization's decision to use psychometric testing.For example: Better job performance as indicated by higher productivity (e.g., boosted conversions) Minimized turnover rates translate to higher cost-saving on replacements. (e.g., fewer new hires required for replacement x per-employee cost for replacement) Better workplace safety and increased productivity, quality, and employee motivation (e.g., fewer safety incidents x average or typical cost associated with each incident) Better team dynamics and collaboration because of better hiring decisionsNow, let us head to the calculation part with an example:Let us assume the combined expenses of implementing psychometric testing in ABC Pvt. Ltd. amount to US50,000, and the gains, which consist of increased productivity and decreased turnover, add up to US80,000; then the ROI would be: (80,000 50,000) 50,000 x 100 60Hence, ABC Ltd. received US1.6 in returns for each dollar spent on psychometric testing.Maximizing psychometric testing ROI with Mercer MettlIn todays volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) business environment, where uncertainty and ambiguity prevail, making informed hiring decisions and emphasizing employee development becomes crucial to ensure organizational resilience and adaptability.

These tests help employers understand candidate persona, ensure appropriate career guidance, and improve hiring diversity. Psychometric tests usually employ a wide range of formats, including multiple-choice questions, situational judgment scenarios, and interactive tasks, to evaluate different aspects of candidates psychological makeup.The need for psychometrics in recruitmentWhen hiring, HR managers may experience unconscious bias, overpowering their recruitment decisions. Psychometric tests help eliminate this bias and allow HR managers to identify suitable candidates for a job position based on their psychometric and technical abilities. Employers can assess different factors using psychometric testing, such as positive personality traits, dark personality traits, behavior, cognitive abilities, motivation, preferences, and values.Comprehensive evaluationResumes and interviews may offer a subjective understanding of candidates skills and abilities.

They measure candidates personality traits, behavior, motivation, values, and preferences. This helps employers make informed decisions based on standardized assessments .Fairness and objectivity Psychometric tests provide a standardized assessment for every candidate, regardless of background. This eliminates biases and discriminations based on factors like gender, race, or education.As a result, employers are able to promote equal opportunities by ensuring selection decisions are based on merit, experience, and relevant abilities.Common types of biases present during hiringConfirmation biasConfirmation bias occurs when recruiters or hiring managers interpret information according to their pre-existing beliefs. This bias can be reduced by approaching candidate evaluation with an open mind, considering all relevant information. Hiring managers should utilize structured evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics to ensure consistency and objectivity in assessing candidates.Halo effectThe halo effect refers to the tendency to form a positive or negative impression of candidates based on one or more of their prominent traits. To mitigate the halo effect, HR managers can evaluate candidates based on multiple dimensions and criteria rather than relying on a single quality. It is necessary to encourage multiple perspectives and inputs from different assessors to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.Similarity biasSimilarity bias occurs when recruiters prefer candidates who resemble them in terms of background, experience, or interests. To address similarity bias, hiring managers should seek diverse candidates and ensure an inclusive selection strategy. \r\rBusinesses can implement blind recruitment practices, where personally identifiable information can be eliminated from resumes and applications during initial screening.Unconscious biasUnconscious biases are implicit attitudes that affect the interviewers perceptions and decisions without conscious awareness. To address this bias, hiring managers should offer awareness and unconscious bias training to recruiters. Utilize a structured interview process focusing on job-related competencies and skills, minimizing the potential impact of unconscious biases.How does psychometric testing eliminate bias?When psychometric tests help minimize bias through standardized assessment and accurate results. Some ways in which psychometric testing can contribute to reducing bias are:Standardized administrationPsychometric tests are administered and scored in a standardized manner.

Standardization helps eliminate unconscious and similarity bias during evaluation.Objective evaluationPsychometric tests are designed objectively with specific constructs or abilities using predetermined scoring algorithms and criteria. They aim to minimize subjective judgments and personal biases that can influence decision-making.Fair selectionPsychometric tests are developed using rigorous item analysis techniques. This process involves evaluating each test item for its difficulty level, relevance to the measured construct, and potential for bias.Five tips for eliminating bias during the hiringBlind recruitmentUtilize blind recruitment practices where personally identifiable information, such as name, gender, or ethnicity, is removed from resumes and candidate applications during the initial screening stage. This helps reduce bias based on demographic factors and shifts the focus to qualifications and capabilities.Diverse hiring panelsCreate diverse hiring panels composed of individuals from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Multiple assessors can provide different viewpoints and help counteract individual biases.Data-driven decision-making Use data analytics to track and analyze recruitment processes, including the demographics of candidate pools, application-to-interview ratios, and selection outcomes. Regularly reviewing these metrics helps identify any potential biases and take corrective actions.Multiple interviewers and assessment methodsInvolve multiple interviewers and incorporate different assessment methods, such as structured interviews, behavioral assessments, and skills-based evaluations. This reduces the impact of individual biases and provides a comprehensive candidate evaluation.Collaboration with diversity and inclusion initiativesCollaborate with diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization to ensure alignment and share best practices. Leverage their expertise to identify and address biases in the recruitment process effectively.ConclusionPre-employment psychometric testing has emerged as a valuable tool for fair and inclusive hiring. Organizations can minimize the impact of recruitment bias in traditional recruitment processes by focusing on objective measurements of candidates skills and abilities.Mercer Mettls psychometric tests help evaluate candidates personality traits, intelligence, aptitude, and behavioral styles.

Different people have different learning styles and different organizations have different learning and development objectives. Employee development programs must be tailored to the needs of each employee and can comprise various learning and development methods and activities.Popular learning and development methods Formal learning:This method is a goal-oriented, group-based situation and generally involves a classroom setting. It has limited linear interactions and is instructor-led. Informal learning:This is an unstructured, organic, and self-directed method, in which employees train on the job, through individual study, feedback, tasks, and co-worker interactions. Experiential learning:This method follows a trial-and-error approach where people try doing something, assess their results, and gain a better understanding from their experience. Coaching:This method involves workplace relationships that focus on empowering employees to achieve their goals. Coaches meet them regularly for open conversations, providing them with direction, feedback, and support. Mentoring:Mentoring refers to a collaborative relationship that pairs employees with seniors or experts in their field, someone from whom they can learn and grow professionally. Mentors are almost like role models, listening to their mentees, answering questions, clarifying their doubts, and offering guidance. Skill building:This method is about helping employees acquire new skills and competencies. The main objective behind this learning and development method is to fill any skills gaps within the organization to stay relevant and achieve business goals. Targeted training:This learning and development method is also designed with the aim of bridging any existing skills gaps within the organization. The method uses both formal and informal learning approaches to meet the learning needs of specific employees. By identifying the exact skills that are required, organizations can distribute resources more efficiently. Cross-training:This learning and development method involves teaching employees how they are supposed to handle the role of another employee, who is generally from a different department. Cross-training allows employees to acquire new skills and helps them understand the organizations operations better. These employees are also able to cover for absent employees and can pitch in to help in situations where a team is overwhelmed with tasks.Popular learning and development activities Workshops:Workshops are interactive experiences, and they are great for fostering teamwork within the organization. These are easy to organize and cost-effective, but workshops are not the best choice for individual learning. Lectures and seminars:Attending lectures or seminars is an activity that is best suited for the formal learning approach. These are to-the-point and short, delivering necessary information in a designated timeframe. Video training:Video training courses seem like an easy option for several organizations, as they allow employees to see the videos on their own time and complete the course at their own pace. Webinars:Webinars are feasible for remote employees. The interactive component in the webinar, like QA or quizzes, helps employees clear their doubts and ask questions. Peer learning:This learning and development activity is an example of intuitive knowledge exchanges. It can include social learning formats, training with peers, coaching, job shadowing, and microlearning.Examples of learning and development programsOrientation and onboarding:Job orientation and onboarding journeys are important for helping new hires settle into their job role and the organization.Soft skills development: Soft skills refer to certain personality traits, interpersonal skills, and behaviors, which people use to interact with others at the workplace. Soft skills may not be as tangible as hard skills, but they are just as important.Technical skills development:There are several roles in organizations that require technical skills. These are skills that can be improved through education and training.Product services training:Customer-facing job roles require employees to have full knowledge of the organizations product or service offerings. As the products or services can be updated at any time and new lines being rolled out, regular learning and development programs help ensure that employees are up to date with the offerings, USPs, and benefits of products and services.Safety training:Health and safety training sessions should be held regularly. They are essential for ensuring employee safety and health at work.How to create a learning and development strategyAlign LD strategy with the organizational strategyBefore designing the learning and development strategy, assess the business strategy and answer questions like what skills the existing workforce has, which skills are vital for the organization, what the organization has to offer, what are the needs of customers, how these needs evolve with time, and which situations can impact the organization.Collaborate with the leadershipStakeholders should be involved directly in establishing the learning and development strategy, so it can be ensured that the strategy meets the needs of every department. Conduct surveys about the learning requirements across the organization to gain a better understanding of LD needs. Offer department heads and senior management collaborative input opportunities to enable them to contribute to and endorse the learning and development programs.Identify skills gapsDetermine competencies that are essential for each role. Once that has been done, a skills gap analysis must be performed to identify if there are any potential skill shortages or overlooked employee development opportunities.Plan learning journeysPlanning learning journeys is key to enabling continuous learning for the employees. These plans can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge that are necessary for their job functions.Plan the implementationLearning and development initiatives are implemented across several stages. These may involve articulating the purpose behind the initiative, performing a SWOT analysis to identify the best program, planning the budget that includes the costs for running the program, acquiring detailed information about the ROI of the program, and conducting pilot class trial runs to see if there are any mistakes or issues.Track performanceTracking learning and development metrics, like employee productivity, can help justify the initiative by showing the engagement the initiative generated.Further, assess the impact of the training programs, collect feedback from the learners and identify if there are any areas that may do well with some changes.Challenges in learning and development Diverse needs of a diverse workforce:Learning and development initiatives must be adapted for effectiveness, regardless of who the audience is. For instance, if there is amultigenerational teamwith young, tech-savvy but inexperienced employees as well as older workers with a lot of experience, the learning and development courses should be tailored in a way that they can help both types of employees develop skills that they lack. Soft skills:It is easier to teach specific hard skills required for a specific job role, compared to helping employees develop the soft skills necessary for collaboration and enhancing the workplace environment. Measuring performance:Learners being engaged in the program may indicate that the initiative is effective, but it is still important to be able to measure the overall effectiveness of the courses. Meaningful and measurable learning and development metric must be set to track knowledge transfer and application in the workplace. ROI:Despite the many benefits they have to offer, learning and development programs should be able to prove that the results produced are more significant as compared to the money spent on the program.Mistakes to avoid with learning and development programsForgetting about employee satisfactionApart from measuring the business results of the learning and development initiatives, it is important to find out if the employees are also benefiting from the plan. As these initiatives are planned for the employees, it is crucial to measure employee satisfaction as well.Not assessing skills applicationFor many employees, it is not always possible to immediately apply the knowledge they gain from corporate training, which is why it becomes important for organizations to carefully choose the right learning and development program that will bring practical benefits to the organization.Not setting any metricsIt is crucial to set some measurable learning and development metrics for tracking the performance and impact of the initiative.How to measure the success of learning and development effortsThere are several tools that can be used to measure the success of the program, like employee satisfaction surveys, anonymous surveys, group conversations, one-on-one conversations, pre and post assessments.Learning and development KPIsLearning and development metrics are used to evaluate the programs effectiveness, which helps identify programs that meet objectives. Some metrics to consider include training ROI, cost per employee, assessment scores, and pass rates.To evaluate the impact of the learning and development program on business performance, strategic metrics must be used. LD key performance indicators (KPIs) can help quantify if the company is experiencing increased productivity. Employee productivity rate:This refers to the value generated by employees within a specific period, which is the total output divided by the total input. Revenue growth:This refers to the increase in revenue across a set timeframe, which is dividing the difference between the current revenue and the revenue from the previous period by the previous revenue.

This means shifting from a top-down growth pattern to a bottom-up and collaborative peer-to-peer learning method is necessary for continuous employee upskilling and higher organizational revenue.However, many businesses still consider training by an outside expert over peer-to-peer learning when the opposite might be beneficial.According to Cognitive Research Journal, individuals engaged in P2P training and development are confident and accurate in their answers.Harvard Business Review explained that peer-to-peer learning creates a natural learning mechanism that is already our innate method of learning new skills. They define it as a learning loop:People acquire new abilities best when they are exposed to all four phases of learning, including gaining knowledge, practicing by implementing that knowledge, receiving feedback, and reflecting on whatever has been learned.All these four factors are a part of peer-to-peer learning.What is peer-to-peer learning?Peer-to-peer learning enables individuals in a team to learn from one another cooperatively. The idea behind this approach originates from group-based classroom learning, where students were encouraged to learn together to understand concepts better.This employee training program provides valuable and feasible LD medium to employees. The approach is structured but flexible to drive motivation and engagement among teams.Benefits of peer-to-peer learningMore than half of employees turn to their colleagues for educational experiences and problem-solving assistance.HBR poll Heres why peer-to-peer learning benefits businesses:Better knowledge sharingIt is known that learning by sharing or teaching is a viable method to enhance your grasp of data and knowledge. In the peer-to-peer employee training program, colleagues learn together, share knowledge, and better understand intricate concepts.These knowledge-sharing sessions also create a safe space for introverts and shy colleagues to ask questions and resolve doubts. As a result, they are more likely to share concerns with peers than with an external evaluator.Cost-effective methodIncorporating peer learning may lead to improved skill degrees in the firm, particularly when staff already have an association.Companies that invest in peer-to-peer learning programs spend less on outsourced training and seminars. Peer-to-peer learning is almost free as the already-hired skilled employees teach each other. It helps them overcome the experience gap.When this learning is received from outside experts, employees need to dedicate a specific amount of time from their schedule for classes and training. Contrary to this, employees can save time in a peer-to-peer learning culture .Companys culture strengtheningEmployees are more willing to learn from their colleagues as they relate to their peers than executives at higher positions. Learning from colleagues who have already achieved success is inspiring.Hence, peer-to-peer learning encourages sharing knowledge, offering constructive feedback, and respecting different perspectives, which creates a strong company culture.Easy onboardingPeer-to-peer learning can help organizations create a seamless and warm onboarding experience for new employees. Whenever a new employee is onboarded, an existing employee can share the knowledge and help settle into the team and organization quickly. Likewise, a new employee can go to peers with questions regarding the project or organizational policies to avail answers and clarifications in less time.Existing employees can help new employees feel comfortable and clarify doubts they cannot ask managers or higher management. Even if an employee joins the organization remotely, efficient communication and knowledge sharing about the work culture can make the onboarding process seamless and smooth.Proper peer feedbackConstructive feedback is an art that is hard to learn, and the peer-to-peer learning model helps overcome this challenge. Mentors or peers learn to offer and receive feedback constructively and positively. This allows every employee to evolve their skills and learn through the valuable input of colleagues and peers.As a result, an important feedback loop is developed in the workplace, which ensures high efficiency and productivity.Best peer-to-peer learning strategiesOrganizations can foster peer-to-peer learning through the following strategies:1. Develop a secure environmentThe most important step is creating a secure environment where peers feel free to ask questions, raise doubts, and share feedback. And organizations can create a safe environment to promote peer-to-peer learning by enforcing the following guidelines .No questions should be considered unimportant Feedback must be constructive Respect new ideas, opinions, and perspectives These guidelines will help employees bridge the skills set gap and strengthen the companys culture.2. Assign a facilitator Organizations can assign a facilitator to coordinate and track the progress to encourage peer-to-peer learning . This facilitator should have prior leadership experience to create an organized rotational structure for employees. This will prevent employees from getting overwhelmed and help bring different perspectives to several processes and tasks.3. Pair up on rotationOrganizations can pair employees with different peers to encourage the adoption of new perspectives, ideas, and solutions. Employees can get exposure to others skill sets, knowledge, leadership styles, and teaching methods. This peer-to-peer learning strategy will improve the interaction between different team members and departments. In addition, it will help employees learn the art of communicating with people with diverse personalities.4. Provide real-life challengesOrganizations can pair new joiners with experienced employees who can provide real-life problems and solutions related to their jobs. As a result, new employees learn practically and develop interpersonal and soft skills during the process. It will be a two-way street rather than a one-way struggle.5. Offer incentives to raise participationPeer-to-peer learning involves commitment, engagement, and effort. Offering incentives to employees who actively participate and make a difference will encourage participation. It is optional to provide financial incentives but should include things to aid career progression.Some tips for the same are: Use games to create a productive and competitive environment via challenges, leaderboards, and achievement prizes. One of the valuable methods is recognition of some type. Praise employee efforts and create a champions board to encourage others to share knowledge.6. Utilize technologyTechnology implementation is one of the critical factors in implementing peer-to-peer learning strategies . The remote working culture arrived with the Covid-19 pandemic. Providing digital learning and interactive platforms will allow participants to share ideas, teach new concepts, clarify doubts, and offer solutions. This will foster collaboration even when team members are located in different parts of the world.7. Lunch and learn sessionsLunch and learn sessions add to the above strategies in a social and relaxed environment. Like brainstorming sessions conducted in a natural setup without pressure, lunch and learn sessions help peers collaborate on exciting topics, engage in a group discussion, and share expertise.While in a formal setup, employees are often hesitant to resolve doubts or ask questions, this method helps host events and discuss challenges and issues from every possible angle.It is imperative to initially encourage motivation in such sessions with a complimentary lunch.8. Organize feedback sessionsThe facilitator must hold mandatory feedback sessions in the initial stages of peer-to-peer learning. Create a written report to improve communication and ensure constructive criticism. It will invoke practical and critical thinking in employees, scrutinizing how a task has been completed and challenges have been tackled.9. Bottom-up needs analysisThe bottom-up needs approach is a method in which the workforce declares its learning requirements. This increases the chances of offering actual learning benefits to employees. In reality, most businesses follow a top-down approach where the management decides LD needs and describes learning gaps and associated goals.Utilizing a bottom-up training method helps employees get involved in their own professional growth. This ensures the correct identification of learning gaps and appropriate peer-to-peer learning strategies for these challenges.10. Job shadowing programJob shadowing program involves real-life training in different job roles. The method helps employees understand job pressures, intricacies, and requirements for varied functions. As a result, cross-role empathy is developed across teams.For example, when allowed to observe the work of an accounting or sales professional, a marketing team professional may understand their daily struggles closely. Hence, it will help each member develop empathy and respect towards different job roles, improving cross-team compatibility and collaboration.Besides building cross-team empathy, job shadowing encourages employees to explore varied roles that may seem more relevant to them. For example, many professionals want to change careers, and job shadowing will help them judge the possibilities and feasibility of the new role.How to create a fruitful employee training programThe following are the steps that organizations should take to create an effective employee training program:1. Assess the training requirementsThe first step involves determining the requirements and finding the gaps in the learning and development strategy. This will allow the development of training programs, determining areas in which their employees need improvement, and identifying the markers of success.Organizations can research current trends or ask employees about their training needs.Mercer Mettl provides a Training Needs Analysis Assessment to help organizations determine the skills gaps and training needs of employees. The assessment follows a structured process to identify challenges and understand the reskilling requirements of the workforce. It helps find agile employees who have the power to learn effectively and quickly and identify professionals who have the closest skills.Based on the findings, it is possible to create a dedicated peer-to-peer learning strategy for different employees according to their requirements.2. Provide interactive trainingThe training methods have dramatically shifted from traditional training models to interactive and engagement-based learning. The hybrid and remote working culture has pushed organizations to change training approaches.Use interactive and engagement-based training in the following ways: Online training can be provided through live or pre-recorded training sessions. Employees can attend sessions live and interact with trainers. It is also possible to access training sections in their own time and learn. Case studies can help employees analyze real-world scenarios and learn from how problems were solved in different departments. Group discussions can be a great way to learn. It is a peer-to-peer learning approach in which peers can share ideas, perspectives, and solutions to help analyze different problem-solving methods.3. Measure and modifyOnce training initiatives are in place, organizations should track the progress and effectiveness of these training programs. This can be done through regular tests, employee feedback, and employee skill set assessments. If employees are not satisfied with training programs and do not feel these are solving any problems or bridging the gap, there is a need to modify the approach or methodology.Mercer Mettl provides a Training Effectiveness Measurement Tool to help organizations determine the effectiveness of new training initiatives. Hence, organizations can bridge the skill set gap, save training costs, and strengthen the companys culture with a clear focus on peer-to-peer learning paired with results from the Training Effectiveness Assessment.Mercer Mettl learning and development toolsMercer Mettl strives to help organizations meet their training objectives through different online and offline learning and development tools and services.For leadership development, Mercer Mettl has the following tools: IdentifyHigh Potential Identify employees with high potential to develop and retain top talent.

Training Effectiveness Determine which training initiatives are effective in upgrading the skill set, knowledge, and behavior of employees.ConclusionPeer-to-peer learning is one of the best ways to develop a learning environment in an organization. It creates a culture of cooperation, collaboration, and growth. Employees are more inclined to learn from their peers as they relate to them more than their managers or professionals from higher management.Organizations should promote peer-to-peer learning to build a culture of cooperation, save training costs of outside trainers and experts, and ensure the transfer of knowledge, skills, and information to create future leaders. It also strengthens current skills while increasing efficiency, morale, and employee experience.FAQsHow can peer-to-peer be implemented in the workplace?Here are some suggestions for implementing successful peer-to-peer learning in the workplace: \ri) Make a recommendation for a peer learning guide,\r\rii) Include a companion network,\riii) Reward involvement in peer-to-peer learning,\riv) Invest in tools for interactive employee training programs and learning,\rv) Plan networking activities.What is the advantage of peer-to-peer learning?Peer-to-peer learning allows individuals to share their expertise in a relaxed and flexible environment. Sharing information amongst peers is less intimidating than organizing and delivering a formal demonstration on a subject. This collaborative environment fosters a desire to learn from mistakes.Is peer-to-peer learning meaningful in an organization? Why?Peer-to-peer learning encourages cooperation and teamwork to obtain information. Indeed, it is up to the learners to solve a problem using a concept and several pieces of knowledge without the assistance of a teacher. Every learner serves both as a receiver and giver of information.What is the aim of a peer-to-peer learning day session? Employees benefit from peer-to-peer learning because it fosters a collaborative environment. New hires can learn from more experienced staff.

How does capacitance affect it? I need to connect an ESD diode for protection against static electricity, as described in the ublox NEO-M8M-0 documentation. I chose a diode with the parameters I need, but I noticed that it has a capacitance of 50 pF at 1 MHz. Will this capacitance affect the signal? The neural network simply states that if your capacitance is higher than 1 pF, you will have low resistance, similar to a low-value resistor, and if the capacitance is lower, the resistance will be higher and the signal will not leak there. Is this true? antenna esd begingroupWhat you have to use in RF paths is often called \"ultra low capacitance ESD diode\" or similar. Example:mouser.senewlittelfuselittelfuse-sp3130-diode-arraysendgroupLundinLundin2026-02-20 15:01:28 00:00Commented3 hours ago1 Answer1The hardware integration guide, p.11 https:content.u-blox.comsitesdefaultfilesNEO-8Q-NEO-M8-FW3HIMUBX-15029985.pdf?utmcontentUBX-15029985 suggests the antenna port is 50 controlled impedance.Presumably, the antenna presents an impedance around 50 at one end of the transmission line, the receiver 50 at the other end, and the Thevenin impedance at any point on the line is the parallel combination of these, 25. (Real matching may not be so exact, but resistance within 30 or so can reasonably be expected. A comparable amount of reactance (i.e. j30) might also be present.)Assuming modest VSWR exists is acceptable, the maximum capacitance that can be connected is a fraction (say half to third) of cutoff at the maximum frequency of interest.Cutoff frequency is calculated: fo frac12 pi R C Rearranging to solve for C, we find about 4pF. 2pF or less would therefore be preferable.TVS diodes of such rating are widely available.50pF would effectively short out the transmission line. It will not be perfectly shorted; component ESL will be dominant, and less than 5nH will have significant impact on transmission. Given how weak GPS signals are, even a SOD-123 sized device is likely to be prohibitive.Protection might not be necessary at all. ESD has dominant energy up to the low 100s MHz. A narrowband antenna already avoids the bulk of energy present. Still, ESD is a lot of energy (depending on required test level), and receiver structures are quite small (sensitive to overload), so it's worth checking in general; but a satisfactory solution is not guaranteed to require a component here. There are also other solutions and mitigations, like using an antenna with sharper LF cutoff, a smaller antenna, static-dissipative materials, or simply putting physical distance between the antenna and anything that can be struck by ESD.Your AnswerThanks for contributing an answer to Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange!

How can I start one? - Help Center - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange What is a bounty? How can I start one?If youve asked a good question , edited it with status and progress updates, and still are not receiving answers , you can draw attention to your question by placing a bounty on it.A bounty is a special reputation award given to answers. It is funded by the personal reputation of the user who offers it, and is non-refundable . If you see a question that has not gotten a satisfactory answer, a bounty may help attract more attention and more answers. Slice off anywhere from 50 to 500 of your own hard-earned reputation, and attach it to any question as a bounty . You do not need to be the asker of the question to offer a bounty on it. All bounties are paid for up front and non-refundable under any circumstances. If your new reputation brings you below the requirement for anyprivileges, you will lose access to those privileges. Users may only have three active bounties at any given time. Questions may only have one active question bounty at any given time. To avoid overly promotional bounties, if you are offering a bounty on a question that you have already posted an answer to, your minimum spend is 100 reputation (not 50). Additionally, if you offer multiple bounties on the same question, the minimum spend doubles with each subsequent bounty (50 reputation on the first bounty, 100 reputation on the second, 200 on the third, and so on). You may not cancel a bounty once it has been started.What happens when I start a bounty?The bountied question will appear with a special indicator in all question lists, and it will also be visible on the homepage Bountied tab for 7 days. Part of what youre paying for with the bounty is to get additional attention for your question, over and beyond what a normal question gets. In that regard, a bounty does not guarantee a response, and reputation refunds are not available if no answers are received as a result of the bounty.How do I start a bounty? When can I start a bounty?A bounty can be started on a question two days after the question was asked.To start a bounty, click on the \"start a bounty\" link at the bottom of an eligible question and allocate anywhere between 50 and 500 reputation, in 50-point increments. You can also choose from a list of bounty reasons to help other users understand why youre dissatisfied with any current answers to the question. If you need to describe something in more detail, theres also optional, additional custom text that will be displayed with the bounty reason.How is a bounty awarded? The bounty period lasts 7 days. Bounties must have a minimum duration of at least 1 day. After the bounty ends, there is a grace period of 24 hours to manually award the bounty. Simply click the bounty award icon next to each answer to permanently award your bounty to the answerer. (You cannot award a bounty to your own answer.)If you do not award your bounty within 7 days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with a minimum score of 2 will be awarded half the bounty amount (or the full amount, if the answer is also accepted). If two or more eligible answers have the same score (their scores are tied), the oldest answer is chosen. If there's no answer meeting those criteria, no bounty is awarded to anyone.If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer posted during the bounty period, and the bounty expires without an explicit award then we assume the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration.As a special bonus, any reputation you earn from being awarded a bounty is exempt from the daily reputation cap.

Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, youre asking too much.If your motivation for asking the question is I would like to participate in a discussion about , then you should not be asking here. However, if your motivation is I would like others to explain to me, then you are probably OK. (Such discussions are, of course, welcome in Chat .)To prevent your question from being flagged and possibly deleted , avoid asking subjective questions where ... every answer is equally valid: Whats your favorite ? your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: I use for , what do you use? there is no actual problem to be solved: Im curious if other people feel like I do. you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: What if happened? your question is just a rant in disguise: sucks, am I right?(The above section was adapted from MetaFilters FAQ.)Some subjective questions are allowed, but subjective does not mean anything goes.

Page 7: Why can people edit my posts? How does editing work? - Help Center - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange Why can people edit my posts? How does editing work?All contributions are licensed under Creative Commons, and this site is collaboratively edited, like Wikipedia. If you see something that needs improvement, edit it!Editing is important for keeping posts clear, relevant, and up-to-date. If you are not comfortable with the idea of your contributions being collaboratively edited by other trusted users, this may not be the site for you.When should I edit posts?Any time you see a post that needs improvement and are inclined to suggest an edit, you are welcome to do so.Some common reasons to edit a post are: To fix grammatical or spelling mistakes To clarify the meaning of the post (withoutchangingthat meaning) To include additional information only found in comments, so that all of the information relevant to the post is contained in one place To correct minor mistakes or add updates as the post ages To add related resources or hyperlinksTiny, trivial edits are discouraged ; try to make the post significantly better when you edit, correcting all problems that you observe.What happens when I edit a post?The post will be updated to show the latest editor, as well as the original author. All edits are saved and tracked in a public revision history with attribution to each editor.A post's revision history can be viewed by clicking the date and time at the bottom of the edited post (e.g., \"edited 3 days ago\").Editing a question or answer also bumps the question to the top of the homepage.Who makes sure that proposed edits are good?Any user can propose edits, but not all edits are publicly visible immediately. If a user has less than 2,000 reputation, the suggested edit is placed in a review queue . Two accept or reject votes are required to remove the suggested edit from the queue and either apply the edit to the post or discard it.Users with more than 2,000 reputation are considered trusted community members, and can edit posts without going through the review process. The original author of a question or answer may always edit their own post, regardless of reputation level.What happens if someone suggests a bad edit?If a user without edit privileges proposes an edit that does not comply with the guidelines above, it is ordinarily rejected in the review process. Even if a bad edit is applied to a post, other users will generally fix it. Users with sufficient reputation may elect to roll back the post to a previous version (by viewing the revision history of the post and selecting the version they would like to display).Additionally, any user who submits many rejected edits will be banned from suggesting further edits for 7 days.What is a rollback?A rollback reverts a post to a previous version in the edit history. The rollback action itself then appears as the most recent item in the edit history. Page 8: Why and how are some questions deleted? - Help Center - Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange Why and how are some questions deleted?Questions that are extremely off-topic , or of very low quality, may be removed at the discretion of the community and moderators.Over time, closed questions that are not useful as signposts to other questions may also be removed, as well as questions which have no significant activity over a very long period after being asked. If you want to improve a question to keep it from being deleted, click the \"Edit\" button beneath it. See the Help Center page \" How do I ask a good question? \" for more tips on improving questions.Users can typically delete their own questions (with a few exceptions). To do so, simply click the \"Delete\" button underneath the question.You can't delete your own question if one or more of the following is true: It has an answer with one or more upvotes (regardless of the answer's net score) It has multiple answers (even if they have no upvotes) It has an accepted answer It has an answer (that isn't deleted) with an awarded bounty Another question has beenclosed as a duplicateof itQuestions can also be deleted by the community. Moderators can delete any question, and users with 10,000 reputation can cast delete votes on closed questions . It takes 3 votes, minimum, for a user to delete a closed question in this way (with more delete votes required for popular posts , based on the score of the question and its highest-scoring answer). Questions that have been closed within the past 48 hours usually can't be deleted, so as to allow them to be edited and possibly reopened .Additionally, any post that accumulates enough rude or abusive or spam flags will be automatically deleted. Questions can also be automatically deleted based on a number of other criteria.What happens when a post is deleted?Once a post has been deleted, it will disappear for all users except staff, moderators, and users with at least 10,000 reputation. Deleted questions and answers are always visible to their authors, regardless of the author's reputation.Self-deleted posts can be viewed and undeleted by their original authors. If you delete your own question, you must undelete it before you are able to edit it.Note that deleted posts do not normally appear in search results. To find questions you posted that are deleted, see the Deleted questions page (which is linked at the bottom of the Questions page of your user profile). In addition, users with the moderator tools privilege can search among their own deleted posts by using the search operator deleted:1 ( site moderators can use this to find deleted posts by any user on the site).Deleted posts can be undeleted by casting undelete votes. Once a question has 3 undelete votes (or more, for popular posts ), it will no longer be deleted. (Site moderators can undelete any post singlehandedly.) For more details about how post deletion works, see this community-curated FAQ on Meta Stack Exchange .If your answer was deleted, please see the Help Center page \" Why and how are some answers deleted? \" instead.

They can also be incredibly nerve-wracking! The best way to calm any pre-interview jitters is to prepare well-crafted responses to the major questions coming your way.While you cant predict exactly what the hiring manager will ask you, you can come up with answers to the most common questions. This guide contains the top 100 questions that hiring managers ask in a job interview.Before getting to the list, lets consider why its so important to prepare for job interview questions, rather than just winging it.Why Should You Prepare for Job Interview Questions?Interviews are important; theres no getting around that. Theyre often your first opportunity to communicate directly with a hiring manager and advocate for yourself as the best person for the job.While some interviews are more conversational than others, none of them feel like the most natural social dynamic. The interviewers going to ask you some open-ended, some specific questions about your skills and experiences, and you should be prepared to answer them in a strategic way. The last thing you want to do is go blank or start rambling about your childhood dog.To excel in your interview, you should prepare your responses to common interview questions. With enough mock interview practice leading up to the real thing, you can make sure your answers sound natural and leave an excellent impression.For more on how to answer common interview questions, check out our guide with tips and sample responses ! For now, lets go over how this list of 100 questions is sorted into categories.How Does This List Work?No interviewer's going to ask you 100 questions in a row unless they possess truly transcendent levels of cruelty. However, they might sample a few questions from each of the below categories to get a full sense of your skills and experiences. There are five categories of questions in this list: traditional, behavioral, cultural fit, logistical, and curveballs. Traditional questionsare the ones with which you might already be familiar. They tend to be open-ended and ask about your background, goals, and work style. Behavioral questionsare some of the trickiest, because they ask you to provide specific examples that illustrate an achievement, a learning experience, or even a failure. Cultural fit questionsare also common, and theyre particularly important for organizations that place high value in workplace culture. These may feel more personal or creative, but your answers should still be tailored to the organization at hand. Logistical questionstend to focus on your work history, how long you plan to stay, and salary expectations. Curveball questionsare the random ones that you might expect during an icebreaker on your first day of summer camp. Dont dismiss these questions as unimportant, though, as theyre an opportunity to let your personality shine through. Curveball questions can also be another way that the manager gauges cultural fit.Traditional questions are the ones with which you might already be familiar.

That ones at the end of the list, and its a virtually universal question that every interviewee must be prepared to answer!Before getting to that final essential question, plus some extra tips on how to prepare , lets start in with some of the most common traditional job interview questions.The \"tell me about yourself\" prompt is an old classic, like apple pie at Thanksgiving. Don't be surprised if your interviewer brings it to the table.Traditional Questions: Who Are You? What Are Your Qualifications for the Job?The questions in this category are fairly common interview questions that interviewers have been asking for years. Theyre often some of the first questions in an interview that get the conversational ball rolling as the interviewer explores your professional skills, attitudes, and experiences.Check out the traditional job interview questions below, and then scroll down for some tips on how to prepare for these types of questions.Common Traditional Job Interview QuestionsTips for Answering Traditional Questions As you can see, traditional questions tend to ask about your skills and what you would bring to the job. While some of the questions may sound more personal, like tell me about yourself or what makes you unique? theyre all openers to advocate for your professional qualifications.Your answers, therefore, should be tailored to the job and organization. A common mistake is to talk only about your own goals and what youre looking for in a new job. While a hiring manager does want to see your motivations and passions, she's also concerned with making a successful hire. She needs to see not just what you want, but what you could do for her organization.As you prepare your responses, then, you should consider the job description and what the company seeks. If one of the core competencies, or main skills, of the job is teamwork and collaboration, then you probably shouldnt start talking about how much you prefer to work alone. You should bring in the core competencies of the job in your responses, albeit in a natural-sounding way.In addition to tailoring your responses, a second tip for answering these questions is bringing in specific examples. Who doesnt like to hear a good story? Even if the question doesnt ask for a specific example, you could often benefit from sharing one, especially if you're someone who tends to drift into vague language. To make your answers more concrete, you could pinpoint particular instances from your past.The next category, behavioral questions, explicitly asks you to bring in specific examples. Unless youre a pro at thinking on your feet, these can be some of the most difficult questions to answer on the spot. Luckily, youll be prepared with your examples before you walk in the door!Interviewers ask behavioral questions so that you'll give specific examples of times that you succeeded, handled conflict, or, like this tired corkscrew, went above and beyond the call of duty.Behavioral Questions: How Do You Act on the Job?As someone who struggles to come up with a specific example when put on the spot, I think behavioral questions are pretty much the worst. At the same time, theyre also super common. Chances are, youll get asked a bunch of behavioral questions in your job interview.Hiring managers dont just want to hear abstract ideas about your work ethic or skills. They want to hear about specific times when you achieved something, managed conflict, or bounced back after a failure.One rationale for these questions is that past behavior indicates future behavior. By gaining a sense of what youve done in the past, the hiring manager has a clearer vision of how youll perform in the future. The other reason behind these questions is that behavioral questions and answers are simply more interesting. They call for specific stories, and these stories make your candidacy more memorable and colorful. You want to leave a great impression, and intriguing anecdotes are one way to accomplish this.Below youll find some common examples of behavioral questions, followed by some tips for answering them.Common Behavioral Questions35. Can you describe a time you demonstrated leadership?36. Can you speak to a time that you had to handle criticism of your work?37. Tell me about a time when your workload was especially heavy and how you dealt with it.38. What would you do if you were asked to take on more assignments than you could conceivably finish by the expected deadlines?39. Can you give me an example of a time you had to follow a policy with which you didnt agree?40. Tell me about a time you went above and beyond expectations at work.41. Have you ever worked on a time when someone was not pulling his weight? What did you do?42. Have you ever had trouble working with a manager?43. Can you tell me about a time your boss disagreed with something you did? How did you deal with it?44. How do you handle difficult customers?45. How do you deal with stressful situations?46. Have you ever had to deal with a coworker who put you down at work? What did you do?47. Can you tell me about a time that you faced a difficult situation with a colleague?48. Give me an example of a time that you failed.49. Have you ever had to give someone tough feedback? How did you go about that?50. Have you ever gone against official policy or directives? Why? What were the results?51. Can you give me an example of a challenge or conflict you faced at work? Describe how you handled it.Tips for Answering Behavioral QuestionsAs you can see, behavioral questions explicitly ask you to give specific examples. Your mission, then? To highlight success stories that show you possess some of the core competencies the interviewer is looking for.Just as all your answers should be tailored to the job at hand, so too should your examples be chosen based on the job description and organization. If problem-solving is a big part of the prospective job, then choose an example, if possible, that demonstrates your problem-solving skills.Similarly, if youre asked to provide a failure, dont choose a story where you failed because you lack one of the core competencies. If the position wants you to be highly organized, dont go on and on about your problems with organization. In fact, you could subtly highlight the opposite; maybe there was a time you failed to look at the big picture because you were too concerned with details of organization, and youve since learned how to balance the two. As you know by now, you should tailor your responses, but dont just tell the interviewer what you think she wants to hear or choose a cop-out answer, like I work too hard or I care too much. You still want to be authentic and true to yourself.The best way to ace these behavioral questions is to show up with a few prepared success stories in your mental suitcase. Perhaps you can pack four or five that relate to the most common questions - a time you showed leadership, a challenge you faced, a story about teamwork, an example of problem solving, and an instance of failure.One final tip about that describe a time that you failed prompt - dont focus too much on failure. Be honest about the failure, but show how you saw it as a learning opportunity. Talk about how you acknowledged, addressed, and grew from your mistake. Your attitude toward setbacks may be just as important as the story you share.Now that you have a sense of those tricky behavioral questions and how to prepare for them, lets look at the next major category: questions that aim to gauge your cultural fit.Maybe your ideal workplace values teamwork, innovation, or indoor climbing walls. Let the interviewer know what draws you to its culture.Cultural Fit Questions: Do You Share Our Values?Organizational culture has always been important for employees, and today it seems to be even more so. Many private companies, in particular, pay a ton of attention to workplace values and the happiness levels of employees. Good morale and workplace perks can improve individual performance, retention, and teamwork, as well as prevent workplace conflict.Many hiring managers, therefore, will ask interview questions aimed at gaining a sense of your cultural fit. Check out some of the questions below, and then read on for a few tips on how to prepare for them.Common Cultural Fit Questions52. What does teamwork mean to you?53. What three qualities do you look for in a workplace?54. How would you deal with a coworker you dont get along with?55. How well would you say you adapt to change?56. What are you passionate about?57. Describe your ideal company culture. What four or five characteristics does it have?58. Who inspires you and why?59. What motivates you to come into work everyday?60. What was it like working at your last company?61. What are some of your workplace values?62. Do you prefer a more structured work environment or one where you can be more entrepreneurial?63. What personality types would you say you work best with?64. What are some activities you like to do outside of work, and how do they benefit your day-to-day job?65. What would your friends tell me about you?Tips for Answering Cultural Fit Questions As you can see, a lot of these cultural fit questions focus on workplace values. They also bring out soft skills, like communication, flexibility, motivation, passion, and outside interests.While these questions are opportunities to let your personality shine through, dont forget that youre in a job interview. You still want to customize your answers to the organization, and the best way to do this is to research its culture online and, if possible, by speaking to its employees. The company websites a great resource, as well as sites like LinkedIn and Glassdoor. If you know any people who work there, definitely reach out and ask them about their experiences.These cultural fit questions work two ways. The manager wants to see how youd fit in, but you also want to make sure the culture aligns with your values and work style. Make sure its the sort of place youd like to work and could be successful. Find out about values, and, if you share them, reflect this understanding and alignment in your responses.Logistical questions might ask about a gap in employment or a career change, such as, \"Going from a dog walker to a NASA astronaut seems like a big change. Could you speak on that a bit?\"Logistical Questions: Employment History and Salary ExpectationsLogistical questions tend to be straightforward. They might ask about details on your resume, your professional goals, or your salary expectations. Some of these questions, especially about salary, may show up later in the hiring process, like in a second interview.You should be prepared to discuss them, though, just in case. Below are some common questions that fall into this logistical category.Common Logistical Questions66. You worked at your last company for a long time. Will it be difficult moving to a new firm?67. Why have you changed jobs so often over the past few years?68. If you got this job, how long would you plan to stay with us?69. What did you earn at your last job?70.

Would you jump ship if you received another offer?77. What other companies are you applying to?78. Why did you freelance for a long period of time?79. What caused you to leave your last position?80. Why do you want to leave your current position?81. Why did you take a job that seems unrelated to your career path?Tips for Answering Logistical Questions While you may have already talked about your skills and experiences, these logistical questions will get you talking specifically about your professional history. Be prepared to speak on your last job, its responsibilities, and your reasons for applying elsewhere.If you have any gaps in employment or are making a career change, you should also be ready to speak on that. As for salary, interviewers may save this question for later in the hiring process, like a second interview. You shouldnt be dishonest about what youve made in the past, but you may decline to share by saying that the two jobs are so different, you dont feel your last salary applies to the current situation.If youre just not sure, do some research on the company website and sites like Payscale and Glassdoor to see what you could expect from a comparable position. Ive found these sites sometimes have such a big range its hard to be sure, but you can look at the available information and then decide what's a reasonable range for you.Again, as you should in all your responses, make sure to communicate your enthusiasm for the position and commitment to the organization should you be hired.Finally, lets consider the fifth category of questions, the curveballs.Don't get thrown by random questions, like, \"If you were a vacation, would you be a camping trip, a group tour, or a luxury spa?\" Actually, maybe that one's from a Buzzfeed quiz.Curveball Questions: The Odd and UnexpectedWe've reached the quirky curveball questions. Like they sound, these questions run the gambit of total randomness. They tend to be odd and imaginative, and are mainly asked to gain a sense of your personality and ability to think on your feet. Of course, if you've already prepared for the right ones, then you wont have to think on your feet!Some questions aim to root out your entrepreneurial qualities or vision. Others seek to see how you self-reflect and make decisions. Others, well - its hard to say what some of these are getting at. Thats why I decided to call them curveballs!Check out some potential curveball questions below, along with ten real-life examples that interviewers from big companies, like Dropbox and Trader Joes have asked prospective employees.

Sure, to some extent. While you may not know exactly what questions youll get asked, you can hone your skills of thinking on your feet.Improv actors, for example, dont just get up on stage and see what happens. They keep their imaginations active and flexible with improv activities. You might similarly try a rapid-fire question and answer practice session to see what you come up with. You should find that your answers come easier and more creative the more you warm up.As with all your other answers, you might be able to tailor your responses to the job. For instance, if you get asked about what kind of animal you would be, you could choose one thats associated with leadership, like a lion, cleverness, like a monkey, or strong work ethic, like an ant, depending on what the job's looking for.At the same time, try not to overthink these too much. Theyre more lighthearted and chances to reveal your personality and sense of humor. And if you find your mind totally goes blank, you could try to buy a little extra time with the old trick of, Thats a great question. Ill have to think about that for a second...Now that youve read over 99 common interview questions in the five major categories, lets take a look at the final question that almost every interviewer asks at the end of your meeting.Even if your interviewer doesn't ask you any of the previous 99 questions, you can be pretty sure that she'll ask you this next one!Final Crucial Job Interview QuestionFinally, youve made it to the end of the list and have seen 99 of the most common traditional, behavioral, cultural fit, logistical, and curveball questions that might come your way in the job interview. But we promised you 100 questions, and saved the nearly universal question for last. This question is an absolute must for your interview preparation. Almost every interviewer asks it, and theres definitely a way that you can answer it wrong. Here it is:100. Do you have any questions for me?Tips for the Final QuestionThis final questions not a particularly hard one, but it is very important. The biggest mistake you could make here is to say, Nope! The answer to this question should always be yes, and you should have at least two thoughtful questions to ask your interviewer.You may be sick of reading about how your answers should be tailored to the job and organization at hand, so Ill just say it one last time: your questions should be tailored to the job and organization at hand (sorry).Your questions are one more opportunity to show your interest and enthusiasm. You can show that youve researched the organization and have a strong understanding of its culture and mission. Dont ask questions that can be easily answered with a Google search. Similarly, dont ask ones that you just talked about ten minutes before.What you already know about the company can inform your questions , though, as it shows youve done some digging. You might say, \"I saw on your website that one of your long-term goals is xxx . Could you tell me about some of the specific steps youll be taking in the next few months to work toward this?\"You could ask about a typical day in the office, what your team members would be like, or what qualities the company values most in its employees. For more suggestions on questions to ask at the end of your interview, check out this question and answer guide .So there you have it, one hundred of the most common questions that get asked in job interviews. In closing, lets go over the key pieces of advice to remember as you prepare to rock your job interview.Here's one piece of advice: Do your preparation before you get to the interview!Preparing for Interview Questions: Final Words of AdviceInterviews can be an intimidating hurdle in the hiring process, but believe it or not, they can also be exciting! Theyre your opportunity to speak with your next potential manager and teammate, learn more about an organization, and show that youre the best person for the job.With enough preparation, you can give succinct, thoughtful responses to any interview question. While you may not be able to completely eliminate all the unknowns, you can definitely reduce them considerably. As you consider how you would answer the above questions, make sure you keep these four main guidelines in mind.Research the Job, Organization, and Your InterviewerIn order to give a good interview, you must be knowledgeable about the job youre applying for and the organization you wish to join. This knowledge will help you prepare tailored responses and present yourself as the best candidate for the job. You should thoroughly read the job description and learn about the organization from its website. You might read about it in news articles or reach out to current or former employees for their views. Once you have a clearer understanding of the job and workplace culture , you can start to analyze your own skillset to see how it matches up. This process of deconstructing the job description is an important step in customizing your answers, as you'll read below.Beyond researching the job and company, you should see also seek to learn more about your interviewer . You might track the person down on LinkedIn or via a bio on the company's website. You might discover a shared interest or personal connection that could spark conversation, whether you bring it up explicitly or not.I have a friend who learned that his next interviewer grew up on a military base in Georgia. When he interviewed, my friend used a bunch of military-related metaphors when describing his ideal management style. Apparently, his interviewer loved it, and my friend got the job.You don't want to creep out your interviewer by repeating her LinkedIn profile back to her, but you might discover a shared interest and work it into the conversation. In addition to showing your enthusiasm for the job and organization, making a personal connection with your interviewer can never hurt!Collect Your Success StoriesHave you ever heard the phrase, \"Show, don't tell\"? It means that you should give specific, illustrative examples and avoid vague, abstract language. It's a good rule for improving your writing, and it's a good rule for improving your interview answers, too.Anyone can talk about how detail-oriented they are, but only people who actually possess this quality can share specific examples. Not only will anecdotes prove what you say about yourself, but they'll also be more memorable to the interviewer.As you read above, behavioral questions are all the rage these days. Interviewers want to get beyond the basics and dig into your past behaviors and experiences. They want to learn about how you've met a challenge, handled conflict, or interacted with your team in the past to get a clearer vision of how you'll behave in the new role.To answer these questions, you should be prepared with a few tried-and-true \"success stories\" from your past. These may come from your past job, or, if you're new to the workforce, from your education or perhaps volunteer work.You should be prepared to speak on some common themes , such as a time that you showed leadership, solved a problem, collaborated with your peers, faced a challenge, handled stress and pressure, or resolved conflict. As for the questions that ask about conflict or failure, try to choose an example that you learned. Frame it less as a failure and more as an opportunity for growth and improvement. Consider the context of your examples, like what led up to them and what the ramifications were. The interviewer may very well ask follow-up questions, so you should prepare to speak at length about your stories. This brings us to the next point, preparing for follow-up questions.The interviewer may be happy to follow your lead once the conversation gets flowing. Prepare for follow-up questions on your responses.Prepare for Follow-Up QuestionsAn interview's not an interrogation. Most interviews aren't just going to shoot one question at you after another with nothing more than a nod in response to your answers. While the questions are important, the interviewer is also seeking to have a conversation and get to know you in a relatively brief period of time.Just as you can expect from any conversation, you'll probably get follow-up questions based on your responses. Your interviewer might ask you to give some more detail or provide some more context. If you talked about a challenge at work, the interviewer might ask what situations you think led up to that challenge or what changes in procedure you've made since.Once you've prepared your responses, consider what the interviewer might ask as a follow-up. What details could you elaborate on? How could your response branch into a related, but distinct direction? Just as you don't want to sound too rehearsed, you don't want your responses to be so tightly structured that you can't add additional ideas and details. If you find you have little to say about one of your success stories, then consider choosing one with a bit more substance.Customize All of Your AnswersAs you read in the tips above, you can try to customize just about every one of your responses to the job at hand. Focus on your skills as they relate to the job description.In other words, what you say should not just be about you. It should also very much be about them.In most circumstances, the interviewer wants to make sure her next new hire possesses certain core competencies. Figure out what those core competencies are, and then reflect them in your responses. On the flip side, you might leave out other skills that aren't relevant. Highlight the ones that are most important in this particular context.Even if you don't have direct experience, you can show that you have skills that would transfer well to the role. By highlighting your transferable skills , you can show that you'd be successful in the new role, with or without previous experience.This idea of tailoring your answers to the job and organization is pretty much the fundamental overriding principle of all your interview prep. Aim to be knowledgeable, specific, and prepared to speak at length about what makes you the best person for the job!Whats Next?

Even if you're applying to lots of jobs, you should make sure each of your cover letters is unique and tailored to the target job.Of course, no ones born knowing how to write the perfect cover letter. To help you write yours, this guide has six free samples of cover letters for various jobs. Scroll down to the middle of the article for the cover letter samples, or first check out these tips for writing a cover letter for your job application!Why Are Cover Letters Important?In many cases, your cover letter represents your first communication with your potential employer. Through the written word, you communicate your interest in the new job and make your case for why youd be the best person for the role.The job market's always competitive, but a stand-out cover letter can differentiate you from other candidates. It can also help personalize your candidacy beyond your resume. Remember, everyone's human here. While cover letters range in tone from formal to conversational, the best ones manage to connect with their readers.Hiring managers often sort through applications quickly, deciding in just a few minutes who moves on to an interview and who gets a disappointing email that begins with, Unfortunately - or worse, gets no response at all!As the applicant, your mission is to send a cover letter that gets you noticed and leaves an impression of competence, professionalism, and cultural fit. So how exactly can you fulfill this mission?One way is to make sure your cover letter contains a few key features. Read on for the four most important characteristics of great cover letters!What Should Your Cover Letter Include? 4 Main FeaturesThere are several components that go into a great cover letter. To start this guide, weve picked out four of the most important ones to guide your writing. Your letter should do all of the following.1. It Should Reflect the Job DescriptionPerhaps this goes without saying, but your cover letter should be customized to the job for which youre applying. Dont send a generic letter that could apply to lots of different companies. Beyond simply inserting the organization name and job title, your letter should be a special snowflake, truly customized to the organization and its available role.Don't just show you want a job. Show you want that specific job.The first step in making this happen is deconstructing the job description. Read its requirements closely, and do research into the organization and the industry as a whole. Figure out what qualities they seek and any problems, sometimes referred to as \"pain points,\" that they need solved. Make sure that you reflect this understanding in your letter. Once you have thorough knowledge of the job description, you can analyze your skill set in relation to it. Rather than talking about what youre looking for, explain why your skills and experiences make you a good match for the organization or company. Even if you don't have directly related experience, you can show how your skills would transfer to the role. Explain how you could contribute and bring value to the team.This focus will show the hiring manager(s) that you did your research on the organization and are being thoughtful about your application. By confidently detailing the reasons youd make a good fit, you can convince your reader of the same.The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Make sure your cover letter stays on track!2. It Should Give Specific ExamplesAnother good practice for cover letters is to include specific examples of your professional qualifications and achievements. Rather than solely re-listing the points on your resume, you might expand on them with an example of a past success. Using data, if relevant, is also a powerful way to quantify your accomplishments.For instance, a marketing manager might describe the specific growth of her companys online readership. She could write a sentence or two about a particular campaign that met or exceeded its goals. A school counselor, to give a second example, might mention a student she worked with and that students progress over the year.As you read the sample cover letters, take note of how they contain specific examples of the applicants work.3. It Should Communicate EnthusiasmAs a whole, your letter should convey a sense of enthusiasm for the new job and organization. Simply customizing your letter, as discussed in the first point, will show that you were interested enough in the opportunity to do lots of research.Beyond producing a well-crafted letter, you should incorporate phrases like, I was pleased to find your posting for\" and I was excited to see this opportunity with your organization.Show that you're eager to engage in conversation about the position and what you can contribute. Use positive language to show how excited you are about the opportunity.4. It Should Be Readable, Clear, and ConciseYour cover letter's not the time to write a long-form narrative about everything youve ever done or ever hope to do. Instead, it should be concise and to the point. Cover letters should be a little less than a page, so you want to choose each word carefully and stay on topic.Even if you dont consider yourself a strong writer, you can still definitely produce a strong cover letter. If you find yourself rambling in your first draft, you can pare it down to its leanest form in the editing. Your cover letter should communicate the essentials so that the hiring manager can gain a sense of your qualifications with just a brief skim. To gain a sense of how to do this effectively, check out the cover letter samples below and see how the candidates advocate for themselves via the written word.Feel free to take a close look at these sample cover letters to guide your own writing.Cover Letters: 6 Great Samples and AnalysesNow that you have a sense of what makes a strong cover letter, click on the links below for six samples of cover letters for jobs, each followed by a breakdown of what it does well.

You'll notice that each one includes contact information at the top, as well as the date. This traditional format is good for hard copies or cover letters sent as Word document attachments. If you're pasting your cover letter directly into the body of your email or into a text box on an application portal, then you can leave off this traditional formatting and start with the salutation.You'll find a few more tips on how to format your cover letter below, but first, the samples!

Let's consider each one, starting with the instructions.Follow the Application InstructionsJust as you should research the position and industry before writing your cover letter, you should also make sure to acquaint yourself with any and all application instructions. Many positions will tell you how and when to send your materials, and they might give special guidelines like a word limit or specific question they want you to answer. One important reason to follow application instructions is that they might shape what your cover letter looks like. If you're pasting it into the body of an email or a text box, then you can cut to the chase and start right in. If you're sending it as a Word attachment or a hard copy (rare), then you could add headers and use a traditional form.Check out more tips on format in the next section, but make sure to prioritize any application instructions first and foremost as you prepare your materials!Consider What Format to UseAs you just read, the format you use depends on how you're sending your cover letter , whether as a hard copy Word attachment or pasted directly into the body of your email. If you're typing your cover letter in the body of an email or a text box on a job application portal, then you typically don't need to add any headers. You can just start right in with the salutation. Considering lots of jobs use their own application websites or ask for an email, starting right in with a \"Dear Hiring Manager\" is pretty common.If you're sending a hard copy or attaching the letter as a Word document, then you might include the more traditional format you see reflected in the samples. You'd put a header on top with your name, address, email, and phone number. You could match the header on your cover letter with the header on your resume to give your whole application a cohesive look.Beneath this header, you'd add the date and the contact information of the hiring manager. If you didn't know the specific person, you could just put the name of the company and its address. The date and company information would be lined up with the left hand margin.Overall, the letter may be four to five paragraphs: an introduction, two to three body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Then youll add Sincerely and print your name. You might add your phone number and email beneath your printed name if theyre not already present elsewhere.For a full overview of the structure of your cover letter, check out our full cover letter template cover letter template !Address a Specific PersonWhile it won't always be possible, you should try your best to address a specific person. If the job doesn't indicate a specific point person, try to do some research on the company's website and LinkedIn.If you can't find a particular person, you might make your audience a little more specific by indicating the position in your salutation. For instance, you could write \"Dear Editorial Hiring Manager\" or \"Dear Marketing Manager Search Committee.\"If that doesn't apply, then you could simply write \"Dear Hiring Manager\" or \"Dear Hiring Professional.\" You should probably avoid the generic and distant \"To Whom It May Concern\" (and definitely steer clear of the antiquated \"Dear Sirs\").Stay On Topic Cover letters typically shouldnt exceed one page, meaning you need to pack a punch in just a few words. Besides editing for clarity and keeping your sentences short and to the point, you should also make sure your letter stays on topic throughout.You dont have to address everything on your resume. Just choose the most important skills and qualifications as they relate to the new job. In terms of the flow of ideas, you should order your points according to how relevant they are to the prospective position.If something feels off topic, then cut it out. Generally, your letter will just get stronger through decisive revision.Finish Up StrongThere's some debate out there about the best way to finish up a cover letter. Some hiring managers suggest that you should do everything you can to pursue the position , even stating that you'll follow up in a week to discuss the position or arrange a meeting. Other managers, though, say that this kind of language comes off as aggressive and pushy. They say you should thank them for their time and then wait to hear about next steps.The path you choose largely depends on the type of job and industry you're applying for. A sales professional may show her initiative and communication skills with a follow-up call. Someone in the publishing world, though, may be turned off by this language.Above all, make sure to follow any application instructions. If a job says \"no calls,\" then you should respect that. And if you do decide to state your intentions to follow up, make sure you do actually follow up when you said you would!Your conclusion is your last chance to express your enthusiasm for a position and leave a lasting impression. Be thoughtful about how you finish your letter, and make sure to thank the hiring manager and be clear about how and when she can contact you.In closing, lets go over the key points to remember as you go forth and draft your own cover letters.The search committee's super impressed with your cover letter. They'd love to invite you in for an interview.To Sum UpWriting a cover letter can feel like a tall assignment, but its also an opportunity for you to advocate for yourself in a powerful way. In your cover letter, you can prove to the hiring manager that you understand what shes looking for and are the best person for the job.Your cover letter's often your first impression, so put in the effort to make it professional and enthusiastic. Spend some time deconstructing the job description and analyzing how your skills, knowledge, and qualifications match up.Then present your skills in a clear and concise way and show that you feel passionate about the prospective position. In the end, your cover letter can differentiate you from the pool of other applicants and land you an interview for your dream job!Whats Next?

V. Petrides, PhD is an integral part of a scientific research program that is currently based at the London Psychometric Laboratory in University College London (UCL).The family of TEIQue instruments is available, free of charge, for academic and clinical research, with a wide range of materials also available for commercial purposes.  Translations and adaptations of the various TEIQue forms currently exist in over 20 languages.  Click here to visit the web site for current information on the TEIQue.CREIO Statement Many tests that promise to measure emotional intelligence have appeared in recent years.  Some of these tests seem promising, but many have not been empirically evaluated.  As a service to our visitors, we have reviewed many of these tests and selected those for which there is a substantial body of research (at least five published journal articles or book chapters that provide empirical data based on the test).  However, inclusion of a test on this web site does not constitute an endorsement of that test by CREIO.The Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue) - ScalesTEIQue-Full Form            The TEIQue is a self-report inventory that covers the sampling domain of trait EI (reprinted below) comprehensively. It comprises 153 items, measuring 15 distinct facets, 4 factors, and global trait EI (Petrides, 2009).            TEIQue-Short Form            This is a 30-item questionnaire designed to measure global trait emotional intelligence (trait EI).  It is based on the full form of the TEIQue. Two items from each of the 15 facets of the TEIQue were selected for inclusion, based primarily on their correlations with the corresponding total facet scores (Cooper Petrides, 2010; Petrides Furnham, 2006).TEIQue 360 and 360-Short Form These forms are used for the collection of other-ratings and are available for both the full- and the short-forms of the TEIQue.  They are especially useful for contrasting self versus observer-ratings on trait EI (e.g., in Leadership research and applications).TEIQue-Child Form The Child Form has been designed with Stella Mavroveli, PhD and is based on a sampling domain that has been specifically developed for children aged between 8 and 12 years.  It comprises 75 items responded to on a 5-point scale and measures nine distinct facets (Mavroveli, Petrides, Shove, Whitehead, 2008). The Sampling Domain of Trait Emotional Intelligence in Adults Facets                                                 High scorers perceive themselves as    Adaptability                                          flexible and willing to adapt to new conditions. Assertiveness                                        forthright, frank, and willing to stand up for their rights. Emotion perception (self and others)   clear about their own and other peoples feelings. Emotion expression                              capable of communicating their feelings to others. Emotion management (others)             capable of influencing other peoples feelings. Emotion regulation                              capable of controlling their emotions. Impulsiveness (low)                              reflective and less likely to give in to their urges. Relationships                                        capable of having fulfilling personal relationships. Self-esteem                                         successful and self-confident. Self-motivation                                     driven and unlikely to give up in the face of adversity. Social awareness                                  accomplished networkers with excellent social skills. Stress management                              capable of withstanding pressure and regulating stress. Trait empathy                                       capable of taking someone elses perspective. Trait happiness                                     cheerful and satisfied with their lives. Trait optimism                                      confident and likely to look on the bright side of life. Reprinted with permission from K. V. Petrides.

The Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations (CREIO) is currently made up of 11 core members and 120 additional members who are individuals with a strong record of accomplishment as applied researchers in the field. There also are four organizational and corporate members. The Consortium was founded in the spring of 1996 with the support of the Fetzer Institute. Its initial mandate was to study all that is known about emotional intelligence in the workplace.Emotional Intelligence at Work Social and personal competencies are vital for a healthy and productive life. Self-awareness, optimism, and empathy can enhance satisfaction and productivity at work and in other aspects of life. The workplace is the ideal setting for the promotion of these competencies in adults because work plays a central role in their lives. Not only do most of us spend the largest portion of our waking time at work, but our identity, self-esteem, and well-being are strongly affected by our work experiences.The workplace also is an ideal place for promoting social and emotional competencies because it often is there that people feel their lack most keenly. When people realize that social and emotional abilities hold the key to greater career success, they become eager to develop those abilities. At the same time, as employers recognize that their profit depends on the emotional intelligence of their employees, they become amenable to launching programs that will increase it.Research ProjectsThe following research projects and partnerships have been established by the Consortium. Model Programs Project: One of the first projects was to identify empirically-supported models of best practice for developing emotional intelligence. To date, the Consortium has identified 15 such models. Descriptions of the model programs identified by the Consortium are listed on this web site. The Consortium continues to be interested in programs that are intended to promote at least one of the five dimensions of emotional intelligence described by Daniel Goleman in his books, Emotional Intelligence and Working with Emotional Intelligence. The five dimensions are self-monitoring, self-regulation, self-motivation, empathy, and social skills. In looking for models, the consortium is interested in not only specific programs but also whole organizations -- profit and nonprofit -- that value the nurturing of social and emotional competence.Practice Guidelines: Another project of the Consortium was to develop a set of practice guidelines for organizations that want to excel in this area. To view the guidelines for best practice click here . These guidelines are based on an exhaustive review of the research on training and development in organizations, behavior change, and social and emotional learning. A technical report describing the research studies on which the guidelines are based also can be accessed through this web page. Click here to view the technical report.Research Partnerships: Another goal of the Consortium is to stimulate intellectual inquiry and research partnerships focusing on the measurement and promotion of emotional intelligence in organizations. During the last few years we have expanded CREIO to include corporate and organizational members as well as individual researchers. Together, they have formed partnerships and charted new territory in the application of emotional intelligence to organizations. Click here for additional information on joining CREIO. Listed below is a sample of the types of research that has been conducted by CREIO members with either current or former organizational members of the Consortium. 1.  The Defense Finance Accounting Service (U.S. Federal Government)  -- Several members of CREIO ( Lyle Spencer , Richard Boyatzis , and Cary Cherniss ) helped them to design a management training program based on CREIOs guidelines for best practice (See, Cherniss, Goleman, Emmerling, Cowan, Adler, 1998 )2. Johnson Johnson Standards of Leadership Study -- Dottie Brienza and Kathy Cavallo , with help from Cary Cherniss and other members of CREIO, did a study of the company's 360 leadership survey.  The goal was to determine how much of EI was covered in their current competency model and how well the EI competencies predicted performance.  Kathy Cavallo and Steve Wolff from Hay Group have now completed a 5-year follow-up.  See link below for additional information.3. American Express Financial Advisors: CREIO helped evaluate the Emotional Competence Training for Financial Advisors and publicize guidelines for implementing EI-based programs in corporations.4. Ameriprise Financial Advisors: Robert Emmerling and Lyle Spencer, in collaboration with Think2Perform, conducted an EI-based competency study to determine the specific EI competencies associated with client portfolio performance.5.  Johnson Johnson Team Study -- Vanessa Druskat and Steve Wolff worked with senior leadership to design and conduct a study on the factors that contributed to outstanding team performance throughout the company.News and EventsVIRTUAL OPEN HOUSE - Mon, Oct 27th 7:00 pm ETThe Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations is headquartered within the Organizational Psychology Program at Rutgers University and provides students with the unique opportunity to conduct research and collaborate with and learn from leading experts in the field of emotional intelligence.

Wolff. The following references provide an in-depth discussion of the theory (Druskat Wolff, 2001a, 2001b; Wolff, Druskat, Koman, Messer, 2006).CREIO StatementMany tests that promise to measure emotional intelligence have appeared in recent years.  Some of these tests seem promising, but many have not been empirically evaluated.  As a service to our visitors, we have reviewed many of these tests and selected those for which there is a substantial body of research (at least five published journal articles or book chapters that provide empirical data based on the test).  However, inclusion of a test on this web site does not constitute an endorsement of that test by CREIO.Summary of the Theory Team Emotional Intelligence is based Daniel Golemans (1995) framework of awareness and regulation of emotion at multiple levels but it should not be confused with individual emotional intelligence. The intelligence in a team comes from the patterns of behavior, or norms, that develop as the team goes about its task. Team Emotional Intelligence is a team-level construct and is very different from the individual-level emotional intelligence of team members. Team Emotional Intelligence represents the ability of a team to generate a set of norms that guide the emotional experience in a team in an effective way. There are norms that guide the teams interaction with: its members (individual-level), the team as a whole (team-level), and others outside the team (cross-boundary level). At each of these levels there are norms that create awareness of emotion in the team and norms that regulate team behavior. The nine norms that make up a teams emotional intelligence are shown in the Table below.Interpersonal UnderstandingUnderstand Team MembersConfronting Members Who Break NormsAddress Unacceptable BehaviorSolve Problems ProactivelyCross-Boundary (External)Team Social AwarenessUnderstand Team ContextTeam Management of External RelationshipsBuild External RelationshipsClick here to download the GEC Technical ManualReferencesHamme, C.

Newman, Ph.D., and Judy Purse MAPS., is a self-report survey tool designed to measure an individuals emotional intelligence. The development of the Emotional Capital Report was based primarily on findings from extensive research on the relationship between emotional intelligence and leadership. It provides an efficient, valid assessment of the emotional intelligence factors that support effective leadership behaviors based on a well-researched model of emotional intelligence emotional capital (Newman, 2007).CREIO Statement Many tests that promise to measure emotional intelligence have appeared in recent years.  Some of these tests seem promising, but many have not been empirically evaluated.  As a service to our visitors, we have reviewed many of these tests and selected those for which there is a substantial body of research (at least five published journal articles or book chapters that provide empirical data based on the test).  However, inclusion of a test on this web site does not constitute an endorsement of that test by CREIO.The ECR 360 is a multi-rater edition of the ECR. Used in conjunction with the ECR, the ECR 360 combines a self-report with a multi-rater assessment to provide a complete 360-degree overview of an individuals emotional intelligence.The ECR ECR 360 offer a unique assessment of the components of emotional intelligence that are empirically linked to the specific behaviors of successful leaders. They provide a brief, scientifically valid assessment of emotional intelligence as well as a comprehensive leadership report for developing personal emotional capital, including: A Total Emotional Capital score, scores on 10 emotional and social competencies that are linked to effective leadership, and a score on a validity scale that measures positive response bias. The report also contains: narrative descriptions of the leadership behaviors associated with each competency score; coaching strategies for developing emotional intelligence and leadership; and an action plan for designing a personal blueprint to build emotional capital.The ECR Selection is an effective tool for talent identification and selecting high-performing employees. In addition to providing scores on the ten emotional and social competencies of emotional intelligence, the ECR Selection provides a guide to the interpretation of scores that can be explored during a behavioral interview. The interaction of high scores and low scores are explored in light of their potential impact on performance, and key follow-up questions are presented to guide the interview. A Summary Evaluation section provides an opportunity to evaluate the level of confidence in the candidates emotional intelligence strengths and development needs as well as an opportunity for making recommendations.The Emotional Capital Group Report provides the aggregate scores of a group of individuals for the purpose of understanding the strengths and develop opportunities for a working group or team.ADMINSITRATION The ECR takes approximately 10 to 12 minutes to complete online. Once the assessment is complete the candidate has the option of downloading their report immediately, as well as the option of sending their report to a third party typically a professional coach certified in the interpretation of the ECR. COMPETENCIES THE EMOTIONAL CAPITAL MODEL Inner Focus This cluster of competencies enables you to develop your leadership presence and communicate authentically and openly. The cluster includes: Self-Knowing the capacity to recognize how your feelings and emotions impact upon your personal opinions, attitudes and judgments; Self-Control the capacity to control your emotions well and restrain your actions until you have time to think rationally; Self-Confidence the ability to accept and respect yourself and essentially like the person you are; Self-Reliance the power to be independent in planning and making important decisions and the ability to take responsibility for yourself.Other Focus These competencies enable you to grasp the emotional dimensions of a business situation and enhance your capacity to influence others to achieve productive outcomes. The cluster includes:Empathy the capacity to be aware of, understand, and appreciate the feelings and thoughts of others; Relationship Skills your people skills define your knack for establishing collaborative and mutually rewarding relationships characterized by positive expectations; Straightforwardness the ability to communicate your feelings, thoughts and beliefs openly in a straightforward way.Outer Focus These competencies enable you to take on new challenges and respond creatively and effectively to new opportunities. The cluster includes: Adaptability involves your capacity to react well to change and adjust your emotions, thoughts and behavior to changing situations and be receptive to new ideas; Optimism your capacity to sense opportunities and focus on the possibilities of what can be achieved. Genuine optimism determines your level of resilience and your ability to bounce back from setback; Self-Actualization is the source of your emotional energy. It can also be thought of as a skill belonging to inner focus, but in reality, its the skill that enables you to maintain an enthusiastic commitment to long-term goals and maintain a view of the big picture.CERTIFICATION RocheMartin offers a two-day and three-day ECR ECR 360 certification training that qualifies individuals to administrate and interpret the ECR ECR 360.

Link emotional intelligence to a business need. Support for training and development in emotional intelligence will increase if it is clearly linked to a business need. People in the organization need to see it not as just a \"nice\" thing to do that makes people \"feel good,\" though this may be important and desirable. In order to gain the level of support needed for successful implementation, emotional intelligence must be viewed as something that makes good business sense. 2. Find a powerful sponsor. For better or worse, organizations tend to be political entities. The support of an influential executive thus is vital for a new, unconventional initiative such as emotional intelligence training. Finding a powerful sponsor who can provide political protection and financial backing can make the difference between success and failure.3. Establish a mechanism such as a \"skunkworks\" team for developing the idea. Emotional intelligence is an innovative and unconventional idea in the organizational world. Efforts to promote it in organizations thus can be easily smothered by the rigidity of a bureaucracy. Ideally, it should be developed and initially operated by a self-managed team that has an \"open ticket\" to innovate. The team should have less formality, more flexible roles, and more open flows of information. It also should be kept relatively free of \"creativity killers\" such as surveillance, evaluation, over-control, and arbitrary deadlines. A particularly good way of achieving this type of setting is to establish a \"skunkworks team,\" which was the name of the famed RD team at Lockheed that sequestered itself and produced a number of innovations.4. Use research to evaluate the program and demonstrate its value. Emotional intelligence activities that are not based on solid research are highly vulnerable. Emotional intelligence training, even more than other types of activity, needs to be research-driven. The research should be extensive enough to give key decision-makers confidence that emotional intelligence training is based on sound, objective analysis. Both qualitative and quantitative research have value in securing support.5. Make sure that the programs quality is so high that it is beyond reproach. Because emotional intelligence training is not a traditional business concern, it is vulnerable to criticism. To counteract the detrimental effects of such criticism, it is important to insure that training efforts meet the highest standards. If an emotional intelligence program becomes associated with shoddy, superficial work, resistance to it will increase further. Opponents of such training need few excuses to kill it.6. Infuse emotional intelligence into the organization in a variety of ways. In order to bring emotional intelligence training and development into the mainstream, it is useful to find different ways of positioning and presenting it in the organization. For instance, different versions of a program can be developed for different groups. Multiple infusion helps to normalize and generalize the concept. It also creates a culture in which people are repeatedly reminded of what they have learned and thus are more likely to apply it on the job.7. Find emotionally intelligent leaders to guide implementation. Implementing emotional intelligence initiatives in organizational settings often is a challenging task. Even with the support of powerful sponsors and good timing, one is likely to encounter much resistance. Success depends on the emotional intelligence of those who orchestrate the implementation effort. 8. Move when the timing is right At certain times in the life of any organization, the conditions will be more or less favorable for the implementation of emotional intelligence training and development activities. Those who wish to establish such activities in their organization need to ask themselves whether the timing is right. Sometimes, it may be necessary to wait until conditions are more favorable.News and EventsVIRTUAL OPEN HOUSE - Mon, Oct 27th 7:00 pm ETThe Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations is headquartered within the Organizational Psychology Program at Rutgers University and provides students with the unique opportunity to conduct research and collaborate with and learn from leading experts in the field of emotional intelligence.

The program was specifically designed with two goals in mind, a) to teach employees about the helping potential of support systems and to build skills in mobilizing available support from others at work and b) to teach employees about participatory problem-solving approaches and to build skills in implementing such approaches in work team meetings in the back home setting. This program is structured according to social learning theory with emphasis on modeling and rehearsal of new behaviors. The content of the training includes helping participants understand existing helping networks, strengthening those networks, exploring how social support from others might help solve problems and reduce stress at work, and mapping their own strengths and weaknesses in their own social networks at work. Participants learn to refine their interpersonal skills associated with exchanging social support with others, clarifying misunderstandings, giving constructive feedback, and asking others for help.Results of a program evaluation show participants reported higher levels of supervisory support, experienced higher levels of praise and feedback, and had more contact with co-workers. To date over 2000 human service workers have participated in the program.Program Description The Caregiver Support Program (CSP) was designed specifically for human service workers, particularly those working in group homes and half-way houses for mentally ill or developmentally disabled individuals. The primary goal of the program is to teach the participants skills that will help them cope more effectively with the stresses associated with their work. The program helps the participants recognize the importance of support systems for coping with stress, and it teaches them skills for mobilizing available support from others at work. It also teaches employees about participatory problem-solving approaches and helps them to build skills in implementing such approaches in work team meetings. Thus, it helps participants to develop several self-management and social skills competencies, including adaptability, communication, collaboration and building bonds, conflict management, and team capabilities.The program was designed by staff at the Michigan Prevention Research Center, and it has been implemented numerous times throughout the state of Michigan. Over a thousand staff working in more than 50 different agencies have participated in it. A unique aspect of the program is that staff and their managers are trained together. One staff member and the manager from each home attended the CSP sessions, with the expectation that they would train the rest of the staff on the skills and concepts they had learned.The CSP involved six training sessions. Each session lasted four to five hours. The first three sessions were held a week apart, and the remaining sessions were held two weeks apart. There were 10 staff and 10 managers in each training group. The groups were led by two trainers. The first two sessions focused on helping networks. The participants learned about the various types of social support (emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal). Then they became more aware of how social support could help them to alleviate specific job stresses through a brainstorming activity. Next the participants mapped their own social support networks at work and identified strengths and weaknesses in the networks. Finally they \"refined the interpersonal skills associated with exchanging social support with others, including clarifying misunderstandings, providing constructive feedback, and asking others for help.\"In the third session the participants learned how to conduct a training session back in their homes. They designed a session to train their coworkers in one of the network skills they had learned themselves, and then they practiced delivering it. Sessions 4 and 5 dealt with increasing worker participation in decision making. Participants discussed the value of such participation and then learned how to enhance it through using group problem-solving methods. The last session was devoted to techniques for maintaining the new skills over the long-term.The learning processes used in the program relied heavily on modeling and rehearsal. Trainers modeled new skills and then had participants practice them in the training group. The participants continued to practice the skills until they had developed a feeling of mastery, at which point they were encouraged to try using the skills at their workplaces. The trainers used positive reinforcement throughout the learning process to help participants maintain high levels of motivation and self-efficacy.The learning processes also were based on the premise that the trainers relationship with the participants strongly influenced the change process. The program designers believed it was critical for the participants to view the trainers as \"knowledgeable, likable, admirable, and accepting\". The trainers worked to promote this image by providing \"unconditional positive regard for the participants\" and praise for change efforts. They also made \"moderate self-disclosures about their own attempts at behavior change.\"The program also incorporated several elements designed to facilitate transfer of skills from the training sessions to the work setting. The trainers provided the learners with general principles along with specific skills. They used problems and situations in the training that were similar to those that are encountered in the work settings. They provided a wide range of examples. And they encouraged the participants not only to use the skills back on the job but to train other staff to do so.The program was evaluated with a pre and post test control group design. Group homes initially were randomly assigned to either receive CSP or serve as controls. Data were collected before the program began and five weeks after training ended. The results showed that direct care staff who attended the training sessions reported increased supportive feedback on the job, greater ability to handle disagreements and overload at work, and a better work team climate compared to the controls.

Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.Model Program CriteriaThe Consortium has identified several programs that have successfully raised the level of emotional and social competence for adults in the workplace. There are several different types of programs, including executive and management development, supervisory training, individual coaching, achievement motivation training, self-management training, interpersonal skills training, stress management training, and emotional competence training. The programs also are targeted to a variety of different occupational groups, including executives, middle level managers, first-level supervisors, hourly workers, and unemployed workers, as well as police officers, medical students, and MBA students. In addition to the training and development programs, there is a \"program\" that has been used to select employees with high levels of emotional intelligence.These programs have been reviewed and approved by the members of the Consortium.

Short-term goals include fortifying job seekers ability to resist demoralization and to persist in the face of barriers and setbacks. The long-term goal is to help persons seek employment in settings that maximize economic, social, and psychological rewards. The program helps participants to maintain high levels of motivation, become more adept at finding job leads and interviewing for jobs, and cope with the setbacks and frustrations associated with job-seeking. Results of an evaluation indicated that program participants found employment sooner than a control group. A follow-up study showed continued beneficial effects on monthly earnings, level of employment, and episodes of employer and job changes. Four weeks after the intervention, the participants had earned on average 178 per month more than controls. At four months this advantage in earnings had increased to 227 per month, and by 2-12 years it had grown to 239 per month.Program Description The main objective of this program is to enhance productive job-seeking skills and self-confidence for the unemployed. Short-term goals include fortifying job seekers ability to resist demoralization and to persist in the face of barriers and setbacks. The long term goal is to help persons seek employment in settings that maximize economic, social, and psychological rewards. The program contributes to the development of several social and emotional competencies, including: self-awareness, accurate self-assessment, and self-confidence; adaptability, self-control, and conscientiousness; empathy and organizational awareness; and influence, communication, and building bonds.The JOBS program was developed by a group of psychologists associated with the Michigan Prevention Research Center, located at the University of Michigan. (The Prevention Research Center was involved because another goal of the program is to prevent depression and other psychological problems associated with unemployment.) Initially the program was implemented in the state of Michigan, with participants recruited from the Michigan Employment Security Commission. Since then the program has been adopted in several other states and foreign countries.The original version of the program consisted of eight half-day sessions spanning two weeks. It later was shortened to five four-hour sessions. There are 15 to 20 participants in a session and two trainers, usually one male and one female. A unique feature of the program is that the trainers are also recruited from the ranks of the unemployed. They typically are counselors, teachers, and others who have high levels of certain social and emotional competencies themselves, including flexibility, empathy, self-confidence, and positive outlook. They also have good speaking and listening skills, talent in giving feedback, skill in facilitating group process, and the ability to manage conflict constructively. After they are selected, the trainers go through seven weeks of training before they conduct any sessions.The program relies heavily on active learning techniques such as modeling, role playing, and problem-solving. \"Each session involves broad orienting introductions, dramatizations and modeling sessions in which trainers enact both successful and unsuccessful strategies at each stage of the job-search process.\" There also are \"specific exercises in which participants may test their newfound knowledge and their newly recognized skills in structured but supportive role-playing exercises.\" During the first part of the program, the trainers establish their credibility by discussing their own job-search experiences. Then they teach the participants to \"think like an employer\" and to identify their own marketable skills and to translate those skills into viable job and career options. Participants then learn how to present their skills effectively in phone contacts and job interviews, and they discuss how to deal with various barriers that they are likely to encounter in presenting their skills to an employer. The next stage of training teaches the participants how to engage in effective job-searches by tapping their personal networks and conducting informational interviews.During the next phase of training, participants are \"inoculated\" against the inevitable setbacks they will encounter once they begin to use their new skills to look for jobs. The trainers do this by asking the participants to think about the setbacks, both external and internal, that they are likely to encounter. Then the group identifies alternative solutions for dealing with each of these anticipated difficulties. In the last stage of the program, the participants enact an entire search strategy, including a job interview, and they receive supportive feedback and suggestions for improvement from the trainers and other participants.The JOBS program has been evaluated through two large-scale, randomized field experiments. Compared to controls (who received an 8-page booklet with tips on how to find a new job), participants in the program consistently became re-employed more quickly, found higher quality jobs, and displayed better mental health outcomes (e.g., less clinical depression). For instance, at the time of a 4-month follow-up, 53 percent of the participants were re-employed compared to 29 percent of the control group. Results for a two-and-a-half year follow-up showed continued beneficial effects of the program on monthly earnings, level of employment, and episodes of job changes. In addition, cost-benefit analyses show that the economic benefits of the program exceed its costs. Four weeks after the program ended, the participants were earning on average 178 per month more than the controls. By four months their earnings were 227 per month higher, and after two-and-a-half years they continued to earn 239 per month more than the controls.Vinokur, A. D., Price, R. H., Schul, Y. (1995).

There are several different types of programs, including executive and management development, supervisory training, individual coaching, achievement motivation training, self-management training, interpersonal skills training, stress management training, and emotional competence training. The programs also are targeted to a variety of different occupational groups, including executives, middle level managers, first-level supervisors, hourly workers, and unemployed workers, as well as police officers, medical students, and MBA students. In addition to the training and development programs, there is a \"program\" that has been used to select employees with high levels of emotional intelligence.These programs have been reviewed and approved by the members of the Consortium. In order to be considered a model, a program had to be intended for adult workers and target one or more of the emotional and social competencies associated with emotional intelligence. There also had to be strong evaluation data documenting its effectiveness.If you would like more information about any of these programs, you may contact them directly if a contact is included in the description.

Help Center lessTrait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire--Adolescent Short Form2006, PsycTESTS DatasetRelated papersAbstractThis article aims to investigate the reliability and validity of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Adolescent Short Form (TEIQue-ASF) score in a sample of 440 Greek adolescents. The instrument's score demonstrated good internal consistency and was significantly correlated with core self-evaluations as well with somatic complaints, self-report psychopathology, and personal strengths. It also explained a statistically significant increase in the prediction of outcome variables beyond core self-evaluations. It is concluded that the findings of the present study provide evidence that support the interpretation and use of the TEIQue-ASF score to assess the emotional self-perceptions of Greek adolescents.Key takeaways TEIQue-ASF demonstrates good internal consistency and validity in assessing emotional intelligence in Greek adolescents. The instrument significantly correlates with core self-evaluations (CSES) and somatic complaints. TEIQue-ASF accounts for a 6 unique variance in predicting somatic complaints beyond CSES. High trait emotional intelligence relates to lower self-reported psychopathology and behavioral difficulties. The study supports the use of TEIQue-ASF for evaluating emotional self-perceptions in adolescents.FAQ'sThe study found that the TEIQue-ASF score demonstrated good alpha reliability, indicating strong internal consistency comparable to other versions across various countries.The TEIQue-ASF score was negatively correlated with self-reported psychopathology, indicating that higher emotional functioning relates to fewer emotional and behavioral difficulties.The TEIQue-ASF explained a statistically significant increase in predicting somatic complaints and psychopathology beyond the Core Self-Evaluations Scale, accounting for an additional 6-9 of unique variance.The sample included 440 students aged 15.13 on average, with 58.9 being girls, drawn from 14 schools in Laconia.The research revealed a positive correlation (r .38, p .01) between the TEIQue-ASF score and prosocial behavior, suggesting that higher trait EI promotes social engagement.Related topicsDownload research papers forfree!Related papersTrait emotional intelligence predicts selfesteem and trait anxiety in adolescentsMeasuring Perceived Emotional Intelligence in the Adolescent Population: Psychometric Properties of the Trait Meta-Mood ScaleThe Polish Version of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 in Adolescents: A Measure of Perceived Emotional IntelligenceTesting the incremental validity of Trait Emotional Intelligence: Evidence from an Italian sample of adolescentsMeasuring emotional intelligence in adolescentsTrait Emotional Intelligence, Coping Strategies, and Self-Esteem in Romanian AdolescentsReferences (45)Cited by (3)Frontiers in PsychologyThe Assessment of Trait Emotional Intelligence: Psychometric Characteristics of the TEIQue-Full Form in a Large Italian Adult SampleInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public HealthStrengths Against Psychopathology in Adolescents: Ratifying the Robust Buffer Role of Trait Emotional IntelligenceScientific Journal of Hamadan Nursing and Midwifery Faculty, 2019The Effectiveness of Education of Emotional Intelligence on Work Ethic Belief of Emam Reza Nursing Staff in Kaboodarahang Explore Papers Topics Features Mentions Analytics PDF Packages Advanced Search Search Alerts Journals Academia.edu Journals My submissions Reviewer Hub Why publish with us Testimonials Company About Careers Press Help Center Terms Privacy Copyright Content Policy Page 2: Testimonials - Academia.edu Journals - Academia.edu TestimonialsAuthor TestimonialsMy priority was to publish in a journal that endorses and welcomes open science.

Powered by Academia.edu All journals All articles About Academia Careers Contact us Page 3: Academia.edu About Richard Price, the founder of Academia.edu, had the idea for the company when finishing his PhD at Oxford in philosophy.As Richard was finishing his PhD, he decided he wanted to have a homepage where he could say this is who I am; this is what I have been working on; here are my papers. At the time, Oxford offered a few megabytes of space for personal websites, and you had to write your own HTML, and FTP files to the server yourself. Richard thought there should be a one-click way of creating a homepage, and uploading papers. Having a homepage shouldnt require technical ability. Richard asked a few of his fellow graduate students, and they felt the same way.In the early days, what mattered most of all was growth: growth in users and papers uploaded. In the first few months, we were growing at a linear rate. Some days 37 users would join, the next day 42, the next day 38. We made it to 50,000 users a year later, and someone posted on Facebook Congratulations; heres to 500,000 users. Richard remembers thinking wow, that is a lot. At a linear rate, that is going to take 10x the amount of time it has taken so far.We started to figure out exponential growth, and we got to 500,000 users, and then quickly to 1 million users. Today 266 million users have joined Academia.edu, and around 140,000 people join Academia.edu each day (Figure 1).Academias mission is to accelerate the worlds research. We believe that science is a transformative lever for technological progress.Archimedes' principle, \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world,\" encapsulates this vision.The scientific revolution has significantly driven GDP growth over the past two centuries, as depicted in Figure 2.Science has been pivotal in reducing the cost of clean energy (Figure 3) and has drastically decreased the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease over the last 60 years (Figure 4). Moreover, the cost of sequencing a human genome has plummeted from 100 million in 2001 to 500 today (Figure 5).Accelerating scientific progress means faster advancements in critical areas such as global poverty reduction, clean energy, disease cures, and the development of aligned superintelligence.We have made significant strides in the academic community by providing a platform for researchers to share papers and collaborate globally.

Individuals who are flexible in coping exhibit sensitivity to subtle signals sent by the environment. Therefore, they are able to adjust their behaviour accordingly and function in a more adaptive manner.Participants and procedureThe study included N    1535 participants. The following methods were used: the Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire (FCSQ-14) and the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI).The Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire measures flexibility as a feature of the process of coping with which an individual applies coping strategies. The Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire is an accurate and reliable method of measuring coping flexibility and three of its subscales: the Repertoire of coping strategies, the Changeability of their use, and Reflexivity.The Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire examines three subscales of flexibility, namely, Repertoire of coping strategies, Changeability, and Reflexivity. This measurement is accurate and reliable. The questionnaire is applied to the study of persons exposed to severe or chronic stress at work, when we want to assess the individual's ability to change their functioning in a stressful situation. It can be used to examine healthy and somatically ill people, in the area of research and clinical diagnosis.DownloadsBibliografiaBasiska, M. A. (2015).

    "plain_text": "Pages: 10 Page 1: Stress StressStress can be defined as a state of worry or mental tension caused by a difficult situation. Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. Everyone experiences stress to some degree. The way we respond to stress, however, makes a big difference to our overall well-being.Stress affects both the mind and the body. A little bit of stress is good and can help us perform daily activities. Too much stress can cause physical and mental health problems. Learning how to cope with stress can help us feel less overwhelmed and support our mental and physical well-being.Stress makes it hard for us to relax and can come with a range of emotions, including anxiety and irritability. When stressed, we may find it difficult to concentrate. We may experience headaches or other body pains, an upset stomach or trouble sleeping. We may find we lose our appetite or eat more than usual. Chronic stress can worsen pre-existing health problems and may increase our use of alcohol, tobacco and other substances.Stressful situations can also cause or exacerbate mental health conditions, most commonly anxiety and depression, which require access to health care. When we suffer from a mental health condition, it may be because our symptoms of stress have become persistent and have started affecting our daily functioning, including at work or school.No, everyone reacts differently to stressful situations. Coping styles and symptoms of stress vary from person to person. Yes, it is natural to feel stressed in challenging situations such as job interviews, school exams, unrealistic workloads, an insecure job, or conflict with family, friends or colleagues. For many people stress reduces over time as the situation improves or as they learn to cope emotionally with the situation. Stress tends to be widespread during events such as major economic crises, disease outbreaks, natural disasters, war, and community violence.Most of us manage stress well and continue to function. If we have difficulties coping with stress, we should seek help from a trusted health-care provider or from another trusted person in our community.Learn stress managementWHOs stress management guide Doing what matters in times of stress aims to equip people with practical skills to cope with stress. A few minutes each day are enough to practise the guides self-help techniques. The guide can be used alone or with its accompanying audio exercises.Having a daily schedule can help us use our time efficiently and feel more in control. Set time for regular meals, time with family members, exercise, daily chores and other recreational activities.Getting enough sleep is important for both body and mind. Sleep repairs, relaxes and rejuvenates our body and can help reverse the effect of stress.Good sleep habits (also known as sleep hygiene) include: Be consistent. Go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time each morning, including on the weekends. If possible, make your sleeping area quiet, dark, relaxing and at a comfortable temperature. Limit your use of electronic devices, such as TVs, computers and smart phones, before sleeping. Avoid large meals, caffeine and alcohol before bedtime. Get some exercise. Being physically active during the day can help you fall asleep more easily at night.Connect with others Keep in touch with family and friends and share your concerns and feelings with people you trust. Connecting with others can lift our mood and help us feel less stressed.What we eat and drink can affect our health. Try to eat a balanced diet and to eat at regular intervals. Drink enough fluids. Eat lots of fresh fruits and vegetables if you can.Regular daily exercise can help to reduce stress. This can include walking, as well as more intensive exercise.Limit time following news Spending too much time following news on television and social media can increase stress. Limit the time you spend following the news if it increases your stress.Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An Illustrated Guide Page 2: Mental health Key facts Globally, more than a billion people live with a mental health condition. Affordable, effective and feasible strategies exist to promote, protect and restore mental health. The need for action on mental health is indisputable and urgent. Mental health has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.OverviewMental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is a basic human right.Mental health exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next. At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world.Risks and protective factorsThe risks and protective factors that influence mental health operate at multiple levels.Individual factors such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics can increase vulnerability to mental health problems.Social and environmental factors including poverty, violence, inequality and environmental deprivation also increase the risk of experiencing mental health conditions.Risks can emerge at any stage of life, but those occurring during sensitive developmental periods, especially early childhood, are particularly harmful. For example, harsh parenting and physical punishment can damage child health and bullying is a leading risk factor for mental health conditions.Protective factors similarly occur throughout our lives and help build resilience. They include individual social and emotional skills, positive social interactions, access to quality education, decent work, safe neighbourhoods and strong community ties.Mental health risks and protective factors can be found at different scales. Local challenges affect individuals, families and communities, while global threats such as economic downturns, disease outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies, forced displacement and climate change impact entire populations.No single factor can reliably predict mental health outcomes. Many people exposed to risk factors never develop a mental health condition, while others may be affected without any known risk. However, the interplay of these determinants collectively shapes mental health over time.Mental health promotion and preventionPromotion and prevention efforts aim to improve mental health by addressing individual, social and structural determinants of mental health. Interventions can be designed for individuals, specific groups or whole populations. Because many determinants lie outside the health sector, effective promotion and prevention programmes require cross-sector collaboration. Education, labour, justice, transport, environment, housing, and welfare sectors all have vital roles. The health sector can contribute by embedding promotion and prevention into its services and by leading or supporting multisectoral coordination.Suicide prevention is a global priority and part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Key strategies include limiting access to means, promoting responsible media reporting, supporting social and emotional learning for adolescents, and ensuring early intervention. Banning highly hazardous pesticides is a particularly inexpensive and costeffective intervention for reducing suicide rates.Promoting child and adolescent mental health is another priority. Effective approaches include policies and laws that protect mental health, support for caregivers, school-based programmes and improvements to community and online environments. Among these, school-based social and emotional learning programmes are especially effective across all income levels.Mental health at work is a growing area of interest and can be supported through legislation and regulation, workplace policies, manager training and targeted interventions for workers.Mental health care and treatmentNational efforts to strengthen mental health must focus not only on promoting mental well-being for all, but also on addressing the needs of people with mental health conditions.This is best achieved through community-based mental health care, which is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, helps prevent human rights violations, and delivers better recovery outcomes. Such care should be provided through a coordinated network of services that comprise: integrated mental health services within general health care, typically in general hospitals and through task-sharing with non-specialist care providers in primary health care; dedicated community mental health services, such as community mental health centres and teams, psychosocial rehabilitation, peer support and supported living; and mental health support in non-health settings, including child protection services, school health programmes, and prisons.The vast care gap for common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety means countries must also explore innovative approaches to expand and diversify care. These include non-specialist psychological interventions and digital self-help tools, which can be scaled efficiently and affordably.WHO responseAll WHO Member States have committed to the Comprehensive mental health action plan 20132030 , which aims to improve mental health through four key strategies focused on leadership, community-based care, promotion and prevention, and data. WHOs latest analysis of country performance against the action plan, Mental health atlas 2024 , showed that progress towards the agreed targets remains insufficient.To accelerate action, WHOs World mental health report: transforming mental health for all urges countries to focus on three transformative pathways: deepen the value given to mental health by individuals, communities and governments, backed by meaningful engagement and investment across sectors; reshape environments in homes, schools, workplaces and communities to better protect mental health and prevent mental health conditions; and strengthen mental health care by building community-based networks of accessible, affordable and quality services and supports that meet the full spectrum of needs. WHO places strong emphasis on human rights, empowering people with lived experience, and fostering multisectoral collaboration.WHO continues to work nationally and internationally including in humanitarian settings to provide strategic leadership, evidence, tools and technical support to help governments and partners drive a collective transformation towards better mental health for all. Page 3: Mental health at work Key facts Decent work is good for mental health. Poor working environments including\r discrimination and inequality, excessive workloads, low job control and\r job insecurity pose a risk to mental health. 15 of working-age adults were estimated to have a mental disorder in 2019. Globally, an estimated 12 billion working days\r are lost every year to depression and anxiety at a cost of US 1\r trillion per year in lost productivity. There are effective actions to prevent mental\r health risks at work, protect and promote mental health at work, and\r support workers with mental health conditions.OverviewAlmost 60 of the world population is in work (1) . All workers have the right to a safe and healthy environment at work. Work can protect mental health. Decent work supports good mental health by providing: a livelihood; a sense of confidence, purpose and achievement; an opportunity for positive relationships and inclusion in a community; and a platform for structured routines, among many other benefits.For people with mental health conditions, decent work can contribute to recovery and inclusion, improve confidence and social functioning.Safe and healthy working environments are not only a fundamental right but are also more likely to minimize tension and conflicts at work and improve staff retention, work performance and productivity. Conversely, a lack of effective structures and support\r at work, especially for those living with mental health conditions, can affect a persons ability to enjoy their work and do their job well; it can undermine peoples attendance at work and even stop people getting a job in the first place.Risks to mental health at workAt work, risks to mental health, also called psychosocial risks, may be related to job content or work schedule, specific characteristics of the workplace or opportunities for career development among other things.Risks to mental health at work can include: under-use of skills or being under-skilled for work; excessive workloads or work pace, understaffing; long, unsocial or inflexible hours; lack of control over job design or workload; unsafe or poor physical working conditions; organizational culture that enables negative behaviours; limited support from colleagues or authoritarian supervision; violence, harassment or bullying; discrimination and exclusion; unclear job role; under- or over-promotion; job insecurity, inadequate pay, or poor investment in career development; and conflicting homework demands.More than half the global workforce works in the informal economy (2), where there is no regulatory protection for health and safety. These workers often operate in unsafe working environments, work long hours, have little or no access to social or financial\r protections and face discrimination, all of which can undermine mental health.Although psychosocial risks can be found in all sectors, some workers are more likely to be exposed to them than others, because of what they do or where and how they work. Health, humanitarian or emergency workers often have jobs that carry an elevated\r risk of exposure to adverse events, which can negatively impact mental health. Economic recessions or humanitarian and public health emergencies elicit risks such as job loss, financial instability, reduced employment opportunities or increased unemployment.Work can be a setting which amplifies wider issues that negatively affect mental health, including discrimination and inequality based on factors such as, race, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, social origin, migrant status, religion\r or age.People with severe mental health conditions are more likely to be excluded from employment, and when in employment, they are more likely to experience inequality at work. Being out of work also poses a risk to mental health. Unemployment, job and financial\r insecurity, and recent job loss are risk factors for suicide attempts.Action for mental health at workGovernment, employers, the organizations which represent workers and employers, and other stakeholders responsible for workers health and safety can help to improve mental health at work through action to: prevent work-related mental health conditions by preventing the risks to mental health at work; protect and promote mental health at work; support workers with mental health conditions to participate and thrive in work; and create an enabling environment for change.Action to address mental health at work should be done with the meaningful involvement of workers and their representatives, and persons with lived experience of mental health conditions.Prevent work-related mental health conditionsPreventing mental health conditions at work is about managing psychosocial risks in the workplace. WHO recommends employers do this by implementing organizational interventions that directly target working conditions and environments. Organizational interventions\r are those that assess, and then mitigate, modify or remove workplace risks to mental health. Organizational interventions include, for example, providing flexible working arrangements, or implementing frameworks to deal with violence and harassment\r at work.Protect and promote mental health at workProtecting and promoting mental health at work is about strengthening capacities to recognize and act on mental health conditions at work, particularly for persons responsible for the supervision of others, such as managers.To protect mental health, WHO recommends: manager training for mental health, which helps managers recognize and respond to supervisees experiencing emotional distress; builds interpersonal skills like open communication and active listening; and fosters better understanding\r of how job stressors affect mental health and can be managed; training for workersin mental health literacy and awareness,toimprove knowledge of mental health and reduce stigma against mental health conditions at work; and interventions for individualsto build skills to manage stress and reduce mental health symptoms, including psychosocial interventions and opportunities for leisure-based physical activity.Support people with mental health conditions to participate in and thrive at workPeople living with mental health conditions have a right to participate in work fully and fairly. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides an international agreement for promoting the rights of people with disabilities (including\r psychosocial disabilities), including at work. WHO recommends three interventions to support people with mental health conditions gain, sustain and participate in work: Reasonable accommodationsat work adapt working environments to the capacities, needs and preferences of a worker with a mental health condition. They may include giving individual workers flexible working hours, extra time to complete\r tasks, modified assignments to reduce stress, time off for health appointments or regular supportive meetings with supervisors. Return-to-work programmescombine work-directed care (like reasonable accommodations or phased re-entry to work) with ongoing clinical care to support workers in meaningfully returning to work after an absence associated with mental\r health conditions, while also reducing mental health symptoms. Supported employment initiativeshelp people with severe mental health conditions to get into paid work and maintain their time on work through continue to provide mental health and vocational support.Create an enabling environment for changeBoth governments and employers, in consultation with key stakeholders, can help improve mental health at work by creating an enabling environment for change. In practice this means strengthening: Leadershipand commitment to mental health at work, for example by integrating mental health at work into relevant policies. Investmentof sufficient funds and resources, for example by establishing dedicated budgets for actions to improve mental health at work and making mental health and employment services available to lower-resourced enterprises. Rightsto participate in work, for example by aligning employment laws and regulations with international human rights instruments and implementing non-discrimination policies at work. Integrationof mental health at work across sectors, for example by embedding mental health into existing systems for occupational safety and health. Participationof workers in decision-making, for example by holding meaningful and timely consultations with workers, their representatives and people with lived experience of mental health conditions. Evidenceon psychosocial risks and effectiveness of interventions, for example by ensuring that all guidance and action on mental health at work is based on the latest evidence. Compliancewith laws, regulations and recommendations, for example by integrating mental health into the responsibilities of national labour inspectorates and other compliance mechanisms.WHO responseWHO is committed to improving mental health at work. The WHO global strategy on health, environment and climate change and WHO Comprehensive mental health action plan (20132030) outline relevant principles, objectives and implementation strategies to enable good mental health in the workplace. These include addressing social determinants of mental health, such as living standards and working conditions; reducing stigma and discrimination;\r and increasing access to evidence-based care through health service development, including access to occupational health services. In 2022, WHOs World mental health report: transforming mental health for all ,\r highlighted the workplace as a key example of a setting where transformative action on mental health is needed. The WHO guidelines on mental health at work provide evidence-based recommendations to promote mental health, prevent mental health conditions, and enable people living with mental health conditions to participate and thrive in work. The recommendations cover organizational interventions, manager\r training and worker training, individual interventions, return to work, and gaining employment. The accompanying policy brief by WHO and the International Labour Organization, Mental health at work: policy brief provides a pragmatic framework for implementing the WHO recommendations. It specifically sets out what governments, employers, organizations representing employers and workers, and other stakeholders can do to improve mental health at work.

In 2019, the action plan was extended until 2030 by the Seventy-second World Health Assembly. Then in 2021, the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly endorsed updates to the action plan, including updates to the plans options for implementation and indicators.This updated Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 builds upon its predecessor and sets out clear actions for Member States, the WHO Secretariat and international, regional and national partners to promote mental health and well-being for all, to prevent mental health conditions for those at-risk and to achieve universal coverage for mental health services. While the updated action plan includes new and updated indicators and implementation options, the original four major objectives remain unchanged: more effective leadership and governance for mental health; the provision of comprehensive, integrated mental health and social care services in community-based settings; implementation of strategies for promotion and prevention; and strengthened information systems, evidence and research.Other languagesArabic Chinese French Russian Spanish UkrainianAction Plan flyersWhat Member States can doOther Page 6: Mental Health, Brain Health and Substance Use Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)Mental, neurological, and substance use disorders are common in all regions of the world, affecting every community and age group across all income countries.

Page 7: Mental health Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.At any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances including poverty, violence, disability and inequality are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm.In 2019, 970 million people globally were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common.Mental health conditions can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. They can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.Globally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability. People with severe mental health conditions die 10 to 20 years earlier than the general population. And having a mental health condition increases the risk of suicide and experiencing human rights violations.The economic consequences of mental health conditions are also enormous, with productivity losses significantly outstripping the direct costs of care.All WHO Member States are committed to implementing the Comprehensive mental health action plan 20132030 , which aims to improve mental health by strengthening governance, providing community-based care, implementing promotion and prevention strategies, and strengthening information systems, evidence and research.WHOs World mental health report: transforming mental health for all called on all countries to accelerate progress towards implementing the action plan by deepening the value given to mental health, prioritizing mental health promotion and prevention, and developing networks of community-based services.In 2019, WHO launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (20192023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable mental health care for 100 million more people in 12 priority countries. WHOs Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) similarly aims to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

More women are affected by anxiety disorders than men. Symptoms of anxiety often have onset during childhood or adolescence. There are highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Approximately 1 in 4 people with anxiety disorders receive treatment for this condition.OverviewEveryone can feel anxious sometimes, but people with anxiety disorders often experience fear and worry that is both intense and excessive. These feelings are typically accompanied by physical tension and other behavioural and cognitive symptoms. They are difficult to control, cause significant distress and can last a long time if untreated. Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities and can impair a persons family, social and school or working life.An estimated 4.4 of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder (1) . In 2021, 359 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders (1) .Although highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders exist, only about 1 in 4 people in need (27.6) receive any treatment (2) . Barriers to care include lack of awareness that this is a treatable health condition, lack of investment in mental health services, lack of trained health-care providers, and social stigma.Symptoms and patternsPeople with an anxiety disorder may experience excessive fear or worry about a specific situation (for example, a panic attack or social situation) or, in the case of generalized anxiety disorder, about a broad range of everyday situations. They typically experience these symptoms over an extended period at least several months. Usually they avoid the situations that make them anxious.Other symptoms of anxiety disorders may include: trouble concentrating or making decisions feeling irritable, tense or restless experiencing nausea or abdominal distress having heart palpitations sweating, trembling or shaking trouble sleeping having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom.Anxiety disorders increase the risk for depression and substance use disorders as well as the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.There are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including: generalized anxiety disorder (persistent and excessive worry about daily activities or events); panic disorder (panic attacks and fear of continued panic attacks); social anxiety disorder (high levels of fear and worry about social situations that might make the person feel humiliated, embarrassed or rejected); agoraphobia (excessive fear, worry and avoidance of situations that might cause a person to panic or feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed); separation anxiety disorder (excessive fear or worry about being separated from people with whom the person has a deep emotional bond); specific phobias (intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations that lead to avoidance behaviour and significant distress); and selective mutism (consistent inability to speak in certain social situations, despite the ability to speak comfortably in other settings, primarily affecting children). People may experience more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Symptoms often begin during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. Girls and women are more likely to experience an anxiety disorder than boys and men.Contributing factors and preventionAnxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one.Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions.Effective community-based approaches to prevent anxiety include parental education and school-based programmes to enhance social and emotional learning and build positive coping in children and adolescents. Exercise programmes can also be effective in preventing anxiety disorders in adults.Diagnosis and treatmentThere are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders. People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care.Psychological interventions are essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists. These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world. They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety.Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online. They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy. These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears.In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders.Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, andor treatment availability), and individual preferences.Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness.Self-careSelf-care can play an important role in supporting treatment. To help manage your symptoms of anxiety and promote your overall well-being, you can: avoid or cut down on alcohol and dont use illicit drugs, which can make anxiety worse; exercise regularly, even if its just a short walk; stick to regular eating and sleeping habits as much as possible and eat a healthy diet; learn relaxation techniques, such as slow breathing and progressive muscle relaxation; and develop the habit of mindfulness meditation, even if its just a few minutes per day.WHO responseWHOs Comprehensive mental health action plan 20132030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders.Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are included in the priority conditions covered by WHOs mhGAP Programme . This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health.WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. These interventions have been shown to be effective for multiple mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. An example is the Problem Management Plus (PM) manual , which is based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and uses techniques like stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support. Additionally, the Self-Help Plus (SH) group-based stress management course and WHOs popular Doing What Matters in Times of Stress self-help book describe skills that can be used to reduce anxiety and stress.References(1) 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) online database.

Page 9: Bipolar disorder Key facts Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects a persons mood, energy, activity and thought and is characterized by manic (or hypomanic) and depressive episodes. An estimated 1 in 200 (or 37 million) people live with bipolar disorder worldwide. Bipolar disorder is associated with significant disability and difficulties in many areas of life. Many people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed or untreated and experience discrimination and stigma. There are a range of effective care options, which combine medicines and psychosocial interventions to help people with bipolar disorder stay well.OverviewIn 2021, an estimated 37 million people (or 0.5 of the global population), including approximately 34 million adults,  were living with bipolar disorder (1) . The condition is primarily observed among working-age people, but also in youth. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed.Worldwide, the treatment coverage for people with bipolar disorder is low. Both men and women are often misdiagnosed. Many lack access to services and recommended interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).Stigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder are widespread, both in communities and health services. This can undermine access to health care. It also fuels social exclusion and can limit opportunities for education, employment and housing.Bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders.People with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g. cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care. On average, people with bipolar disorder die on average 13 years earlier than the general population (2) .Symptoms and patternsBipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by mood swings from one extreme to another.During a manic episode, a person experiences an extremely high mood with lots of energy (feeling very happy, excited, overactive). They may have a sense of euphoria, sudden shifts in mood or an excess of emotion (uncontrollable laughing or feeling much more irritable, agitated or restless than usual).In manic episodes, the changes in mood and activities are accompanied by other characteristic symptoms, which may include: highly inflated sense of self-worth or self-esteem; talking quickly and rapidly shifting from one idea to the next; having trouble concentrating and being easily distracted; decreased need for sleep; reckless or risk-taking behaviour, for example overspending, risky sexual activity, drinking, or harming oneself or others; and fixed and mistaken grandiose or persecutory beliefs in something untrue (e.g. I am a very famous person, My neighbour is spying on me). On the contrary, during a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that they had previously enjoyed.Other symptoms are also present, which may include: poor concentration feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth hopelessness about the future thoughts about dying or suicide disrupted sleep changes in appetite or weight feeling very tired or low in energy.A depressive episode is different from mood fluctuations commonly experienced by most people, in that the symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.Both manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school. They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others.Some people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes. Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the persons ability to function to the same extent.There are two main types of bipolar disorder, depending on patterns of manic or hypomanic and depressive episodes. People withbipolar type I disorderexperience one or more manic episodes interspaced with episodes of depression which usually become more common over time (compared with manic episodes). People withbipolar type II disorderhave had one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode, but no history of manic episodes.Risks and protective factorsThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Several factors including biological (e.g. genetic), psychological, social and structural factors may contribute to its onset, trajectory and outcomes.Adverse circumstances or life-altering events can trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of bipolar disorder. These may include bereavement, violence or the breakdown of a relationship. The use of alcohol or drugs can also influence the onset and trajectory of bipolar disorder.Although employment can be a source of stress for people living with bipolar disorder, it can also be protective. Under good working conditions, and when supported at their workplace with reasonable adjustments, employment can promote recovery by improving functioning, reducing symptoms and leading to a higher quality of life and improved self-esteem.Treatment and careEven though symptoms often recur, recovery is possible. With appropriate care, people with bipolar disorder can cope with their symptoms and live meaningful and productive lives.There are a range of effective treatment options, typically a mix of medicines and psychological and psychosocial interventions. Medicines are considered essential for treatment, but themselves are usually insufficient to achieve full recovery. People with bipolar disorder should be treated with respect and dignity and should be meaningfully involved in care choices, including through shared decision-making regarding treatment and care, balancing effectiveness, side-effects and individual preferences.MedicinesPeople with bipolar disorder need treatment and care across acute episodes of mania and depression and when indicated, longer-term treatment to prevent relapse. Mood stabilizers (such as lithium, valproate) and antipsychotics are proven to help manage acute mania. Lithium prescription requires clinical and laboratory monitoring. Girls and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or have childbearing potential should not use valproate. Lithium and carbamazepine also need to be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding whenever possible.Antidepressants should not be taken during a manic episode and they may be combined with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics during episodes of depression.Some medicines for bipolar disorder can make people feel sleepy, have involuntary muscle spasms or tremors, or experience metabolic changes (e.g. involving weight gain). These side effects can affect adherence to treatment and should be monitored and managed.Adults with bipolar disorder who are in complete remission (no symptoms) usually need to continue with mood stabilizers or antipsychotic medicines for at least six months. Those experiencing multiple episodes of mania and depression will usually require longer-term treatment to minimize relapses.Psychological and psychosocial interventionsPeople with bipolar disorder can benefit from lifestyle changes involving regular sleep, physical activity, a healthy diet, reduction of stressors, and mood monitoring.Psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychoeducation) can effectively reduce depressive symptoms and the possibility of them coming back.Family psychoeducation can also help families understand and support their loved one better. Support from family and friends is very important. Support groups where people can receive encouragement, learn coping skills, and share experiences can be helpful to people with bipolar disorder and their families.Recovery-oriented psychosocial interventions include supported employment, supported housing, peer support, and social and life skills training. They serve to promote hope and to support the autonomy, personal empowerment and social inclusion of people with bipolar disorder.Medicines and psychological or psychosocial interventions should be tailored to the needs of the person and combined for best outcomes.WHO responseThe Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013-2030 highlights the steps needed to provide appropriate services for people with mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards the plans objectives by ensuring 100 million more people can access quality and affordable care for mental health conditions.WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) , which is being implemented in more than 100 countries, provides evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to build capacities and expand treatment coverage for a set of priority conditions, including bipolar disorder, in non-specialized settings in LMICs.WHOs guidelines on Management of physical health conditions in adults with severe mental disorders provide evidence-based recommendations to practitioners on how to recognize and manage comorbid physical and mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder.WHOs QualityRights initiative aims to improve the quality of care and human rights standards in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. The Guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches describes what person-centred and human rights-based approaches look like in mental health, and give examples of good practice services.(1) 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) online database.

Page 10: Depressive disorder (depression) Key facts Depression is a common mental disorder. Globally, an estimated 5.7 of adults suffer from depression. More women are affected by depression than men. Depression can lead to suicide. There is effective treatment for mild, moderate and severe depression.Depressive disorder (also known as depression) is a common mental disorder. It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.Depression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.Depression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression. Women are more likely to have depression than men.An estimated 4 of the population experience depression, including 5.7 of adults (4.6 among men and 6.9 among women), and 5.9 of adults aged 70 years and older. Approximately 332 million people in the world have depression (1) . Depression is about 1.5 times more common among women than among men. Worldwide, more than 10 of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression (2) . In 2021, an estimated 727 000 people lost their lives to suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 1529-year-olds.In high-income countries, only about one third of people with depression receive mental health treatment (3) .Barriers to effective care include a lack of investment in mental health care, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders.Symptoms and patternsDuring a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of pleasure or interest in activities.A depressive episode is different from regular mood fluctuations. They last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.Other symptoms are also present, which may include: poor concentration feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth hopelessness about the future thoughts about dying or suicide disrupted sleep changes in appetite or weight feeling very tired or low in energy.Depression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including in the community and at home, work and school.A depressive episode can be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the impact on the individuals functioning.There are different patterns of depressive episodes including: single episode depressive disorder, meaning the persons first and only episode; recurrent depressive disorder, meaning the person has a history of at least two depressive episodes; and bipolar disorder, meaning that depressive episodes alternate with periods of manic symptoms, which include euphoria or irritability, increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour.Contributing factors and prevention Depression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected persons life situation and the depression itself.Depression is closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the factors that influence depression (such as physical inactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing depression due to the difficulties associated with managing their condition.Prevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression. Effective community approaches to prevent depression include school-based programmes to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents. Interventions for parents of children with behavioural problems may reduce parental depressive symptoms and improve outcomes for their children. Exercise programmes for older persons can also be effective in depression prevention.Diagnosis and treatmentThere are effective treatments for depression. These include psychological treatment and medications. Seek care if you have symptoms of depression.Psychological treatments are the first treatments for depression. They can be combined with antidepressant medications in moderate and severe depression. Antidepressant medications are not needed for mild depression.Psychological treatments can teach new ways of thinking, coping or relating to others. They may include talk therapy with professionals and supervised lay therapists. Talk therapy can happen in person or online. Psychological treatments may be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps.Effective psychological treatments for depression include: behavioural activation cognitive behavioural therapy interpersonal psychotherapy problem-solving therapy.Antidepressant medications include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine.Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, andor treatment availability), and individual preferences.Antidepressants should not be used for treating depression in children and are not the first line of treatment in adolescents, among whom they should be used with extra caution.Different medications and treatments are used for bipolar disorder.Self-careSelf-care can play an important role in managing symptoms of depression and promoting overall well-being. try to keep doing activities you used to enjoy stay connected to friends and family exercise regularly, even if its just a short walk stick to regular eating and sleeping habits as much as possible avoid or cut down on alcohol and dont use illicit drugs, which can make depression worse talk to someone you trust about your feelings seek help from a healthcare provider.If you have thoughts of suicide: remember you are not alone, and that many people have gone through what youre experiencing and found help talk to someone you trust about how you feel talk to a health worker, such as a doctor or counsellor join a support group. If you think you are in immediate danger of harming yourself, contact any available emergency services or a crisis line.WHO responseWHOs Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 20132030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental disorders including depression.Depression and self-harmsuicide are among the priority conditions covered by WHOs Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The Programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health.WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals for depression that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. An example is the Problem Management Plus (PM) manual , which describes the use of behavioural activation, stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support. Moreover, the Group Interpersonal Therapy for Depression manual describes group treatment of depression. Finally, the Thinking Healthy manual covers the use of cognitive-behavioural therapy for perinatal depression.1. 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) online database.

Our team is here to assist, but we do not create or manage your project.

However, recruiting agencies are often not the best option. If you want to get started quickly, work within a limited budget, or have more control over participant selection, working with an agency may not be viable.

DISC is an acronym for four basic behavior styles: Drive, Influence, Support, and Clarity. The DISC assessment is a powerful tool that can help you find your ideal career, team up with the right people, and improve communication and productivity in the workplace.The DISC assessment is one of the most popular personality assessments available today. It is used by over one million individuals, businesses and organizations every year to help people find their ideal career, team up with the right people, and improve communication and productivity in the workplace.DISC is an acronym for Drive, Influence, Support, and Clarity. Because there are only four basic behavioral styles in the DISC system, it is easy to learn. Yet, despite its simplicity, the DISC personality assessment describes some of the most fundamental differences between individuals so it is very powerful in terms of understanding why people do what they do and then using this knowledge to reduce conflict and improve working relationships.What the DISC personality test measuresThe DISC journey starts with a simple personality test. The results show where a person falls along two axes of behavior: Active vs. Receptive and Skeptical vs. Agreeable. Taken together, these two axes form a grid, where each quadrant represents one of the four DISC personality types. This is shown in the graphic below:You might see the axes described using other words, such as controlopenness with assertivenessreceptiveness or task-focusedpeople-focused with outgoingreserved. While the language changes from test to test, the assessment itself is measuring the same behaviors.Active vs Receptive: Are you outgoing or reserved?Some people want quick results and are decisive (Active) while others are more careful and quality-conscious in their work style (Receptive). This is represented in the upper and lower parts of the circle. Those who land in the upper part of the circle tend to be fast-paced and outspoken (Drive and Influence). They take action quickly and are energetic in their approach. Those who land in the lower half of the circle speak more slowly and quietly (Support and Clarity). They tend to need more time to consider carefully when making decisions.Skepticism vs Agreeableness: Do you focus on tasks or people?Some people are focused on getting things done and challenging ideas and people (Skepticism), while others are focused on cooperation, relationships and interactions with others (Agreeableness). This is represented in the left and right hemispheres of the circle. The left half of the circle is where youll find Skeptical people (Drive and Clarity) whose workplace style is focused on data, logic and results. The right half of the circle is where youll find Agreeable individuals (Influence and Support) who gravitate towards feelings, experiences and relationships.Finding your DISC type on the graph A person's preference on both axes determines their DISC letter code. For example, someone who is Active and Skeptical will type as a Drive personality. Drive types like to get things done and are competitive, ambitious and results-oriented.Another person may have the same degree of Skepticism as a person with a preference for Drive. But if they are more Reserved, different traits will emerge. This person will have a preference for Clarity, meaning they are more cautious, conscientious and careful with the details.No DISC style is better or worse than any other. They are just different, and each style brings its own strengths and value to the workplace. DISC simply helps us find out which style we tend to gravitate towards the most.History and development of the DISCThe father of DISC was American psychologist William Moulton Marston, who is also credited with inventing the polygraph test. In the 1920s, Marston used his knowledge of physiology and psychology to develop a model of human behavior that he called DISC.Marston's original model had four basic personality types, the initials of which give DISC its name: Dominance, Inducement, Submission and Compliance. These terms have largely fallen out of use and have been replaced with more user-friendly language, but the basic meanings are the same.It's important to note that while Marston's model created the idea of DISC, he did not develop an assessment to measure it. The first DISC assessment was created in 1956 by Walter Clarke, an industrial psychologist. Clarke's model was originally designed for use in businesses to help them choose qualified employees. Clarke also renamed the four factors to Dominance, Influence, Steadiness and Conscientiousness. Many providers still use Clarkes terminology, but at Truity, we prefer the words Drive, Influence, Support, and Clarity as they are more easily understood today.Fast-forward to the 21st century, and DISC theory has been incorporated into a huge number of personality assessments, for instance, the Everything DiSC published by Wiley and Truity's own free DISC assessment . Although different publishers have different approaches to this system, and continually revise their assessments to make them more accurate and relevant, the underlying concepts are similar for all DISC assessments.The four DISC personality typesThere are four basic personality types in DISC. The following is a quick overview of the four primary styles.Drive . Drive relates to control, power and assertiveness. People who are high in Drive like to get things done and are results-oriented. They tend to be ambitious, competitive and persuasive. If you have a lot of Drive, you're likely to enjoy taking on new challenges and being in charge.Influence . Influence relates to people, interaction and communication. People who are high in Influence are interested in relationships, networking and persuasion. If you have a lot of Influence, you're likely to enjoy social situations and working with people. Support . Support relates to patience, thoughtfulness and harmony. People who are high in Support are warm and accepting of others, and they like structure and organization. If you have a lot of Support, you're likely to enjoy working hard behind the scenes and being part of a team.Clarity . Clarity relates to structure, organization and correctness. People who are high in Clarity are detail-oriented, quality-conscious and cautious when making decisions and taking action. If you have a lot of Clarity, you're likely to enjoy working intentionally to solve challenging problems.Curious about your DISC personality type?

In fact, for most people, either one or two predominant personality styles stand out. This gives us 12 common combinations: four pure types, which are designated with the letters D, I, S, and C, and eight combination types which are notated with codes like Di, Cd, and Is. In a combination type, the first letter indicates the most prominent style, and the second indicates a supporting style. Here's an overview of the 12 results:Drive styles Direct and decisive 'doer' Resourceful and self-reliant in pursuing goals Enjoys competition and lively debate Focuses on results and realistic expectations Focused on realistic results more than relationships Maintains efficiency and continuous improvement Is diligent and determined in the pursuit of goals Has high expectations of themselves and othersDi: Drive Influence Resourceful and charismatic Takes charge of social situations Builds rapport and brings people together Takes ownership of resultsInfluence Styles Prioritizes relationships and interaction with others Easily builds rapport, even when first meeting someone Motivates people to take action Cheerful and enthusiastic; brings energy to the teamId: Influence Drive Approaches relationships (people) and situations (tasks) with equal energy Discusses big-picture ideas and future possibilities Involves others in brainstorming to solve problems Adventurous and able to create novel solutions to problemsIs: Influence Support Fosters a collaborative environment where everyone belongs Enjoys spending time with others Adapts easily to a range of work styles Involves people in discussions of how things should be doneSupport Styles Calm, patient and respectful Works cooperatively and takes care of the needs of others Avoids competitive or conflict situations Takes direction from a leader they trustSc: Support Clarity Seeks predictability and consistency Makes decisions carefully Organized and attentive to details Accommodates others to avoid creating conflictSi: Support Influence Shows support and empathy towards other Helps people achieve their goals Easily adapts to difficult situations Promotes the benefits of teamworkClarity Styles Uses a methodical approach when solving problems Makes objective decisions rather than emotional ones Prefers solitary activities over group work Comfortable analyzing large amounts of information Purposeful, efficient and focused Focused on goals rather than relationships Extremely rational when making decisions Strives to improve performance and maintain quality Cs: Clarity Support Responsible, reliable and accountable Exacting and sometimes perfectionistic in their work Considers many factors when making a decision Appreciates guidance and direction from othersUses and applications of DISC typeFirst and foremost, DISC is about self knowledge. As a personal development framework, it can help you understand why you do what you do. When you know your DISC type, you can learn more about what motivates you, how you respond in different work situations and on teams, and how you interact with others. The assessment gives context to behaviors that, at first glance, may seem confusing, unfamiliar or even contradictory.Unlike other personality frameworks which are designed to help people become more self-aware in all areas of life relationships, careers, personal development and so on the DISC personality test is focused on behavior at work. Assessments are frequently used to help teammates better understand one another and how to work together. This makes it an ideal tool for managing teams and making workplace interactions more enjoyable and effective, as well as for individual career selection and development.DISC for managers and teamsDISC not only helps people understand their own drivers and behaviors, it also helps to identify those same things in others. When everyone on a team takes the assessment, managers get a common framework to view each employee. This can guide decision making. For example, understanding how someone responds to deadlines, or how detail-oriented they are, can ensure that assignments are delegated to the right people. Some common applications of DISC in this area include: Team building Conflict resolution Improving communication Gaining clarity around roles and expectations Leadership development Sales training Customer service improvement Time managementDISC for individualsUnderstanding your DISC type can help you find a career that's the best fit for your natural strengths. For example, if you're a high D, you may be suited for a career in law enforcement or entrepreneurship. If you're an I, you might enjoy working in public relations or customer service. Beyond career selection, there are several benefits to gaining practical and unique insights into your work style. These include better communication, better working relationships, better goal achievement, more deliberate career planning and greater self-esteem.What should DISC not be used for?DISC is not recommended for pre-employment screening. While it can give good insight into an individual's behavior at work, it is not a measure of intelligence, aptitude or ability. Every DISC style has the potential to succeed in a sales role, for examplenot just those with Influence and Drive.Can your DISC type change over time? Unlike some other personality tests, the DISC model is not static and does not label people as a certain type. Instead, it provides a snapshot of how a person tends to behave in specific situations and teams. For example, someone may behave in a more task-oriented and direct way (Drive traits) when heading up a time-critical project. But when managing a team of interns, they may take on more of a coaching role (Support).Many work behaviors are situational and or learned. It is common for people to learn new ways to behave at work and to approach projects differently today than they did in the past. In the language of DISC, their natural style has not changed but their adapted style, meaning the way they respond, has.That said, it is rare for a persons core personality to change. The average persons DISC type tends to stay fairly consistent over time. When someone takes a DISC assessment a second or third time, they may not answer the questions exactly the same way but they are unlikely to answer them the opposite way. So, you could get a small difference which may even push you into a neighboring quadrant on the DISC grid, but youre unlikely to have a major shift in work style.Accuracy and validity of DISCDISC has been around for a century, is used by almost three-quarters of Fortune 500 companies, and is the go-to tool of global organizations when it comes to team building, communication training and project management.Various studies of DISC assessment validity and reliability have shown it is on par with other industry-standard psychometric assessments, indicating that it can be effectively used in professional settings.What does this mean? Well, there are two things we look at when figuring out if a test is accurate:Validity , or how well the test measures what it's supposed to measure. In the case of a DISC assessment, that means looking at how well the questions identify the different personality types, and how well those personality types predict behavior in the workplace.Reliability , or how well the test produces consistent results. In other words, if you take the test today and then again next week, will you get the same results? One common measure of reliability is Cronbach's alpha, which has been analyzed for major DISC assessments and found to be generally excellent.Its important to understand that no publisher or company owns DISC theory. This means that anyone can create an assessment and assign the word \"DISC\" to it, so standards may vary wildly from test to test. In general, purchasing a DISC assessment from a respected publisher means the assessment has been studied, often over many years, to ensure it provides accurate results. What about free DISC tests? Well, you may get a high degree of accuracy from a free DISC test or you may not. Some free tests, like Truitys free DISC assessment , have been thoroughly researched and developed by psychometrics professionals. Others do not meet industry standards for validation and reliability, meaning you cannot put much stock in them. To be sure of getting an accurate test, it's important to work with a reputable test provider that has put their test through a rigorous research process to ensure its validity and reliability. When in doubt, go with a paid test from a company you trust.

About the DISC Personality Assessment How the DISC Assessment is Used in the Workplace Drive in the DISC Personality System Influence in the DISC Personality System Support in the DISC Personality System Clarity in the DISC Personality System Page 8: How the DISC Assessment is Used in the Workplace True You Journal How the DISC Assessment is Used in the WorkplaceThe versatile DISC personality assessment is useful for individuals and teams, as it helps you understand your own behavior styles as well as the styles of those around you. The DISC model makes emotional intelligence easier and provides many practical applications for improving workplace communication, conflict resolution, and leadership development. When team members know the DISC profiles of their coworkers, the team can work together better, increasing overall productivity.The DISC personality system measures four primary personality types: Drive , Influence , Support and Clarity . Each type has different strengths, weaknesses and motivations that help explain how we interact with others and our environment in the workplace.On this page, we discuss some of the practical applications of the versatile DISC personality assessment .DISC and teamworkOne of the most obvious benefits of using DISC in the workplace is to improve team dynamics. A high-performing team will alway be greater than the sum of its individual parts and, by understanding the unique strengths and blindspots of each team member, that becomes a real possibility. For example, a person with a Drive-type personality may do very well in a team leadership role or with a project that requires lots of initiative and fast decision-making. They may do less well with a slow-moving project that follows a rigid process. Managers who understand these natural tendencies are in a great position to put the right team members in the right situations and roles.While DISC profiles are often used during the forming and storming phases of team building, where team members are still getting to know each other and individual work styles are appearing, they can also be used on an ongoing basis to help teams work together better. For example, DISC profiles can provide critical insights in the following areas: Building agile teams - An agile team is one that can quickly adapt to change. It is composed of members who are flexible in the way they work and adaptable to the needs of the project, which means that role boundaries are difficult to define. Using DISC in this situation gives valuable insight into each team members natural style of working. Team leaders can capitalize on those strengths and include the right range of personality styles to fit the project. Unsticking stuck teams Long-standing teams can sometimes get bogged down in roles and routines and become stuck. DISC can give team members insights into why theyve fallen into a rut and a new energy to break out of old patterns. It's a way to press the reset button on team dynamics and get everyone back on the same page. Integrating new team members - Another problem with long-standing teams is they have to get used to team members cycling in and out over time. A DISC assessment can help team members get to grips with their own behavior patterns and those of their coworkers, so they know right off the bat what people have in common and where they may diverge. Repairing fractured teams - Unresolved personality clashes within a team can lead to a breakdown in communication and trust. Often, the cause of these fractures can be traced back to a simple misunderstanding about how someone prefers to work. A DISC assessment can help team members understand their differences and find common ground. It can also help managers identify problem areas and put measures in place to prevent future conflict, so the team can better weather the storms.DISC and leadership developmentThe DISC model can provide excellent insights into an individual's leadership style , helping leaders and their organizations understand the strength of leadership capacities in the areas of: Influencing and relationship building Decision making Communication and negotiation Planning and delivery Change management Taking action and risksThis information can be used to identify areas where a leader may need to grow and develop. For example, a leader with a high Drive-type personality might be highly effective at driving bottom-line results but may need to work on their ability to delegate tasks and consider the inputs of others. A leader with a high Clarity-type personality might be very detail-oriented and excel at planning and delivery, but may need to work on their ability to take risks and make decisions quickly. DISC can also be used to assess an individual's potential for leadership roles. Typically, high-potential individuals are assessed on their successes to date, which may not translate into effective leadership. A DISC assessment can provide insights into an individual's natural behaviors and motivations, and how they are likely to cope with the demands of a leadership role in that organization. This information can be used to identify individuals who have the potential to step up into leadership roles in the future and ensure those people are placed in the right development programs so they are ready when the time comes.DISC and productivityProductivity is a measure of a persons efficiency in completing a task, but it involves more than just getting the job done. It's also about doing the job well, on time and to high quality standards. As such, many factors can affect someones productivity levels, including their motivation, stress levels, time management skills, how easy the task is for them to do, and their ability to focus.The DISC model can provide insights into all of these areas and more. Once you recognize an employee's particular workplace style, you can assign tasks, delegate, engage and motivate that person more effectively, leading to higher levels of productivity.How does that work in practice? Heres a snapshot of a manager might help increase productivity of their various team members, according to the persons DISC style:Drive style DO: Set ambitious performance goals as Drive-style people orient themselves around goals and results. But you may need to slow projects down to help them avoid making mistakes and forgetting the small 'unimportant' details. DON'T: Micro-manage or nitpick a Drive personality, or allow focus to drift by giving them too many things at one time.Influence style DO: Ensure tasks are started immediately to avoid procrastination. Also, take some time to review and Influence personalitys plans and schedules are they realistic or too optimistic? DON'T: Allow distractions with too many exciting new projects and watch out for them socializing at the expense of getting the job done.Support style DO: Break large tasks into manageable chunks so the Support style personality can pace themselves to avoid getting overwhelmed. And try to build in opportunities for collaboration, mentoring and team building where possible. DON'T: Allow a Support style to overwork or confuse doing work with results.Clarity style DO: Set timelines and deadlines to avoid a Clarity personality getting bogged down in the details; keep a watchful eye to make sure they're prioritizing the right things. DON'T: Change the goalposts or be vague about what is expected. And make sure theyre not seeking perfection to the point where they spend more time than a task is worth.DISC and employee satisfaction Managers have the greatest impact when they know the strengths of their employees, respect them for the contribution they make, and show appreciation for a job well done. A study by the Society for Human Resource Management found that employees who feel appreciated are more likely to stay with their organization, have higher job satisfaction and are more productive.While all employees appreciate being recognized for whe work they do, different personality types have different motivations. The DISC model can help you to understand what makes your employees tick and how best to show appreciation.For example, a Drive personality would be motivated by a sense of challenge and will be the most satisfied when they feel that they are making a real difference. They want to be in on the action and see things happen.An Influence personality is happiest when working on highly collaborative projects that involve a lot of interaction with others, when they can 'sell' their ideas and see them come to fruition.A Support personality is happiest in collaborative projects that are reasonably paced, steady and involve consistent processes. They feel most satisfied when they can contribute to making things run smoothly.And a Clarity personality is happiest when they can work independently, at their own pace and have the opportunity to really dig into the analysis and all the small details. They feel most satisfied when they can see the tangible results of their work.So, what's the take-away? When it comes to employee satisfaction, one size does not fit all. By understanding the DISC personality styles of your employees, you can tailor your recognition and appreciation strategies to meet their individual needs. And that's a win-win for everyone.DISC and communicationDo you ever feel awkward when talking to certain people? Or find that some people are too accommodating or too confrontational? It may have something to do with the way they communicate. Teams may have the best ideas and the best intentions, but if they cannot communicate effectively, there can be misunderstandings and tension.The DISC model can help you to understand communication preferences and bridge the gaps between different work styles. For example, when you know your own DISC type and those of your team, you can quickly see whether someone: Needs you to go into the detail when describing something, or would prefer you to give the big picture Needs an agenda upfront, or prefers to wing meetings and conversations Likes to be asked their opinion before a decision is made, or prefers to be told what to do Will back off if you put them on the spot, or enjoys debate and confrontation Wants to receive information as facts and data, or prefers to talk in opinions and stories Likes to receive clear instructions about next steps, or would prefer to receive alternatives and choices Likes to plan for socializing in the conversation, or needs you to get straight to the point, no beating around the bush Increasing your awareness around these communication styles and adapting your own style in response is a key skill to have. It can help you influence others with ease, and enables you to build better relationships, resolve conflicts more effectively, and generally just make things run more smoothly.DISC and conflictThere is usually no one cause or simple resolution for conflict between coworkers. However, being able to identify the personality styles of those involved can be a helpful piece of the puzzle. Thats because different personality types tend to approach and react to conflict in different ways. When you understand where the other person is coming from, you can adjust your own dials so you dont automatically respond in a way that escalates, rather than diffuses, the situation.To give you an idea of how this might play out in the workplace, take a look at how the different DISC types typically will respond to conflict:Drive typesDrives tend to be direct and to the point they want to get down to business. They are likely to approach conflict head-on and may come across as confrontational, especially to Support types who may perceive their bluntness as being insensitive.What to do: When communicating with a Drive personality in conflict, it's important to be clear, concise and direct yourself. Don't try to sugarcoat the issue that will only frustrate them. Be prepared to state your case and be ready to back it up with facts and logic.Key diffusing phrases: Can you help me solve this? Let's figure this out together I need your help with something.Influence typesBecause they prefer harmony, Influence types may avoid conflict altogether. Or, if they do find themselves in the middle of a disagreement, they may try to smooth things over by being conciliatory and agreeable, and hide what they're really feeling. This can be seen as appeasing or even disingenuous by Drive and Clarity types who want everything out in the open.What to do: Stay upbeat and use humor to diffuse tense situations. Influence types tend to go off on tangents so keep the conversation focused on the conflict at hand. Don't let them sweep the issue under the rug or try to bring up old conflicts that will only make things worse in the long run.Key diffusing phrases: I'm sorry you feel that way I understand how you could see it that way Let's agree to disagree.Support typesSupport types are typically loyal, warm and empathetic, and they can sometimes have a hard time seeing both sides of a disagreement. They may take things personally and may need some time to process their feelings before they're ready to discuss the issue. What to do: Be sincere, understanding and diplomatic. Don't try to rush them into a decision they need time to think things through. Avoid coming across as confrontational or aggressive as that will only make them more resistant to resolving the issue.Key diffusing phrases: I'm sorry you're feeling so upset I understand how you feel Let's take a break and talk about this later.Clarity typesClarity types tend to be very logical and objective, and they may have a hard time understanding why people get emotional about certain things. They may come across as cold or insensitive, especially to Support and Influence types who may see them as lacking empathy.What to do: When communicating with a Clarity personality in conflict, it's important to be clear and concise. Stick to the facts and avoid getting emotional that will only make them more resistant to resolving the issue. Be prepared to state your case and be ready to back it up with logic and reason.Key diffusing phrases: I see your point That makes sense Let's look at this from a different perspective.DISC and understanding othersThe ability to empathize with others is an essential skill to help you work well with others who may have different perspectives. DISC assessments make emotional intelligence easier in several ways that have a direct impact on job and team performance. For example, DISC can help you: Respond rather than react. When you understand your natural tendencies and the tendencies of others, its easier to listen first and control your reactions in challenging situations. Change your approach. By using the information from a DISC assessment, you can learn how to change your communication style and approach to better suit the needs of those around you. Create common ground. When you know more about the DISC styles of those around you, its easier to focus on the things you have in common instead of the areas where you are apart. Avoid becoming defensive in the face of criticism. Instead of blaming others or getting defensive, you can learn to take responsibility for your part in the situation and work together to find a solution. Express yourself freely. Instead of holding your tongue or becoming passive-aggressive, you can learn to assert yourself in a way that is respectful and diplomatic. Stay professional in every situation. DISC is a valuable tool to help you avoid negative, knee-jerk responses in the form of dismissive, disparaging or judgmental comments and assert yourself in a way that is respectful and diplomatic.In summary, DISC personality testing can help individuals and teams understand how they communicate, work together, lead others and resolve conflicts. When team members are able to understand their own styles and the styles of those around them, they are better equipped to produce results that count.

Well look at common questions designed to assess your interpersonal prowess, alongside strategies for crafting responses that reflect your proficiency in working harmoniously with others.Common Interpersonal Skills Interview Questions1. How have you resolved a conflict between team members in the past?Fostering an environment where collaboration and productivity can thrive despite differing opinions or personalities is crucial when resolving conflicts within a team. The question delves into your ability to understand the root causes of conflict, navigate the emotional landscape of the team, and employ strategies that promote mutual respect and understanding. Its a testament to your emotional intelligence, problem-solving skills, and leadership qualities, as well as your capacity to maintain team cohesion and morale under stress.When responding, outline a specific situation where you encountered a team conflict. Describe the steps you took to address the issue, emphasizing active listening, impartiality, and the promotion of open communication. Highlight how you facilitated a dialogue between the parties involved, helped them find common ground, and worked towards a resolution that respected everyones perspectives and met the teams goals. Conclude with the positive outcomes that resulted from your intervention, such as improved team dynamics or enhanced productivity.Example: In a previous experience, I encountered a situation where two team members had a disagreement over the direction of a project. Recognizing the potential impact on team cohesion and project success, I promptly arranged a meeting to address the issue. I began by actively listening to each partys viewpoint without interrupting, ensuring they felt heard and understood. This helped de-escalate emotions and demonstrated my impartiality.Next, I guided the conversation towards identifying the underlying concerns and interests rather than focusing on positions. By encouraging open communication, the team members were able to express their motivations and apprehensions. I facilitated a brainstorming session where both parties contributed ideas on how to integrate their perspectives. This collaborative approach led to a creative solution that aligned with our collective objectives. The resolution not only resolved the immediate conflict but also strengthened the trust and respect among team members. The process reinforced the value of open dialogue and set a precedent for constructive conflict resolution within the team. As a result, we experienced a noticeable improvement in team dynamics and a boost in productivity, as the members felt more engaged and committed to the projects success.2.

Its an essential skill for maintaining professional relationships and fostering an environment of growth and improvement. The question assesses whether you possess the emotional intelligence to handle such situations without causing unnecessary conflict or demotivation, and whether you can turn a potentially negative interaction into a positive developmental opportunity for your colleague.When responding, begin by emphasizing the importance of creating a private and respectful setting for the conversation. Explain your strategy for ensuring the feedback is specific, actionable, and focused on behavior rather than personal attributes. Illustrate with an example how you would emphasize the value of the colleagues work while presenting areas for improvement, and how you would engage in a dialogue to collaboratively develop a plan for progress. Your response should reflect your ability to be both a supportive team member and a catalyst for professional growth.Example: In delivering negative feedback, my approach is to first establish a private and respectful environment, ensuring the conversation remains confidential and focused. I initiate the dialogue by acknowledging the individuals strengths and the value they bring to the team, which sets a positive tone and demonstrates my appreciation for their contributions.I then provide specific and actionable feedback, concentrating on behaviors and outcomes rather than personal characteristics. For instance, if a colleagues report lacked necessary details, I would point out the specific sections where further information could enhance clarity and usefulness, rather than questioning their overall effort or capability. This method not only facilitates a constructive conversation but also provides clear direction for improvement.Lastly, I encourage a two-way dialogue, inviting the colleague to share their perspective and to collaborate on developing a plan for progress. By doing so, I ensure they feel supported and empowered to make the necessary changes, fostering both professional growth and a positive working relationship.3. What strategies do you use to ensure effective communication in a diverse workplace?In a diverse workplace, effective communication is key to fostering an inclusive environment where different perspectives are valued and collaboration thrives. This question assesses a candidates ability to navigate the nuances of a multicultural environment, their empathy, and their commitment to creating a cohesive team dynamic despite potential language barriers or cultural differences. When responding to this question, candidates should discuss specific methods they employ to adapt their communication style to fit the needs of their audience, such as active listening, clarifying and confirming understanding, and using inclusive language. Additionally, sharing examples of how theyve educated themselves on cultural norms, sought feedback to improve interactions, and leveraged diverse communication channels to accommodate team preferences will demonstrate their proactive approach to maintaining clear and respectful communication.Example: To ensure effective communication in a diverse workplace, I prioritize active listening and empathy, which allows me to understand the perspectives and needs of my colleagues. Recognizing that each individual may have different communication preferences and cultural backgrounds, I make it a point to tailor my approach accordingly. This might involve simplifying language, avoiding jargon, and being mindful of non-verbal cues that can vary significantly across cultures.I also seek to establish a feedback loop, encouraging others to share their thoughts on our communication effectiveness and making adjustments as needed. This approach not only helps in fine-tuning my communication style but also fosters an environment of mutual respect and continuous learning. Additionally, I utilize various communication channels, from face-to-face meetings to written memos or digital platforms, ensuring that the medium chosen is accessible and comfortable for all team members. By combining these strategies, I strive to create an inclusive atmosphere that promotes clarity, collaboration, and a shared understanding among a diverse workforce.4. Share an experience where active listening improved a work situation.Understanding the emotions and intentions behind the words is part of active listening. In the workplace, this skill is essential for resolving conflicts, building teamwork, and ensuring that tasks are understood and executed effectively. By asking for a specific instance of active listening, the interviewer seeks to discern whether a candidate not only values this skill but also can apply it practically to enhance collaboration, clarify misunderstandings, and facilitate a positive work environment.When responding, recount a situation that highlights your ability to focus attentively on the speaker, ask clarifying questions, and provide feedback that confirms comprehension. Your example should reflect your capacity to stay engaged in a conversation, interpret non-verbal cues, and subsequently use the information gleaned to address a problem, improve a process, or support a colleague. This demonstrates your active involvement in workplace dynamics and your commitment to effective communication.Example: In a project where tensions were high due to looming deadlines and misaligned expectations, active listening played a pivotal role in de-escalating the situation. During a critical team meeting, I noticed one of our key stakeholders expressed concerns through not just their words but also their body language they were clearly frustrated but struggling to articulate the root cause. By maintaining eye contact, nodding affirmatively, and paraphrasing their points for clarity, I demonstrated genuine engagement. This approach opened the floor for a more in-depth discussion, allowing the stakeholder to feel heard and valued. Subsequently, I asked targeted questions to delve deeper into their concerns, which revealed a misunderstanding about the projects scope. By actively listening and not dismissing their initial, somewhat vague expressions of dissatisfaction, I was able to identify and clarify the miscommunication. This led to a realignment of project goals and expectations. The outcome was not only a more cohesive team environment but also a clear path forward that satisfied all parties involved, ultimately contributing to the projects success.5. In what ways have you adapted your communication style to better collaborate with others?The ability to communicate in ways that resonate with various personalities and work styles is crucial for effective collaboration. This question delves into the candidates self-awareness and flexibility in adjusting their communication to facilitate smoother interactions and teamwork. It reflects on the candidates understanding that a one-size-fits-all communication approach is often ineffective in a diverse workplace.When responding, highlight specific instances where youve adjusted your communication style to accommodate different team members or work situations. Describe the context, your original communication approach, the cues you picked up on that necessitated a change, and how you adapted your style. Discuss the outcomes of these adaptations, emphasizing improved team dynamics, enhanced understanding, or successful project delivery. Your answer should convey emotional intelligence, a commitment to team cohesion, and a proactive approach to problem-solving through effective communication.Example: In a project involving diverse stakeholders, I recognized the necessity to tailor my communication style to each participants preferences. For instance, with data-driven team members, I focused on presenting information with clear metrics and logical reasoning. Conversely, when engaging with creative individuals, I shifted to a more narrative and visual approach, utilizing storytelling to convey the same data points in a manner that resonated with them.The adaptation of my communication approach was evident during a critical project phase where it was imperative to gain consensus among team members with varying perspectives. By actively listening and observing their communication preferences, I was able to reframe the project goals in a way that was compelling to each stakeholder. This led to a more cohesive team environment and a successful project outcome, as each member felt understood and valued, fostering a collaborative and efficient working dynamic.6. Can you provide an example of how empathy has played a role in your professional relationships?Holding professional relationships together often requires empathy, allowing for a deeper understanding of colleagues perspectives, challenges, and motivations. Its the skill that enables individuals to navigate the social intricacies of the workplace, foster collaboration, and effectively manage conflict. By asking for a real-world example, the interviewer is looking to assess whether a candidate can transcend mere task execution and engage with others on a human level, which is essential for a cohesive work environment and for leadership roles where emotional intelligence is paramount. When responding, choose a scenario that illustrates your ability to genuinely connect with a colleague or client on an emotional level, perhaps during a challenging project or a stressful period. Describe the situation with enough context to show the stakes involved, explain your empathetic approach, and detail the positive outcomes that resulted. Your answer should reflect your ability to read emotional cues, listen actively, and respond in a way that acknowledges others feelings and helps to resolve issues constructively.Example: Absolutely, empathy has been a cornerstone of my professional interactions, particularly during a project that was falling behind schedule, creating a high-stress environment for the team. Recognizing the mounting pressure, I took the initiative to have one-on-one conversations with team members to understand their individual challenges and stressors. Through active listening and acknowledging their concerns without immediate judgment or solutions, I was able to foster a sense of trust and support.This empathetic approach not only helped in identifying the root causes of delays such as personal struggles affecting work performance or a lack of resources but also in collaboratively developing a more realistic project timeline. By validating their feelings and involving them in the problem-solving process, the team felt more engaged and motivated. Consequently, we not only improved our workflow but also strengthened our professional relationships, leading to a more cohesive and resilient team dynamic in the long run.7. Illustrate how you maintain relationships with difficult stakeholders.An intrinsic part of many professional roles is maintaining relationships with difficult stakeholders, reflecting the reality that not all interactions are smooth or straightforward. Success in this area often hinges on the ability to diplomatically navigate divergent interests, manage expectations, and mitigate conflict while maintaining a professional demeanor. This question seeks to uncover if candidates possess the emotional intelligence, patience, and strategic communication skills necessary to maintain productive working relationships, even when faced with challenging personalities or high-stress situations.To respond effectively, candidates should articulate strategies such as active listening, empathy, clear and assertive communication, and problem-solving. They might share a specific example where they turned a contentious situation into a collaborative one, demonstrating their ability to understand the stakeholders perspective, find common ground, and negotiate a solution that respects both the stakeholders needs and the project or companys goals. Its important to convey a sense of resilience and a commitment to positive outcomes, without compromising professional standards or organizational objectives.Example: In maintaining relationships with difficult stakeholders, I prioritize active listening and empathy to fully understand their concerns and perspectives. For instance, I once faced a situation where a stakeholders demands were initially at odds with the projects direction. By engaging in a candid dialogue, I acknowledged their concerns and demonstrated an understanding of their position, which helped to de-escalate tension. Subsequently, I steered the conversation towards collaborative problem-solving, focusing on shared objectives. I proposed alternative solutions that aligned with the stakeholders interests while remaining feasible within the projects constraints. Through assertive communication and a willingness to find a middle ground, we reached an agreement that satisfied all parties involved. This approach not only resolved the immediate issue but also strengthened the relationship in the long term, as it established a foundation of mutual respect and a track record of successful negotiation.8. When was the last time you mediated a misunderstanding within your team, and what was the outcome?Mediating misunderstandings reflects a candidates level of empathy, emotional intelligence, and problem-solving skills, which are essential in conflict resolution. This question assesses the candidates leadership potential and their ability to navigate the social dynamics of a team without escalating tensions or allowing conflicts to derail project progress.When responding to this question, you should recount a specific instance where you played a key role in resolving a misunderstanding. Detail the steps you took to understand each partys perspective, how you facilitated open communication, and the strategies you used to find common ground or a compromise. Conclude with the positive outcome that resulted from your mediation, such as a restored team relationship, continued project momentum, or improved team dynamics. Demonstrating that you can not only resolve conflicts but also turn them into opportunities for team growth and improved communication will make your answer particularly compelling.Example: Recently, I facilitated the resolution of a misunderstanding that stemmed from a miscommunication about project responsibilities. Two team members had overlapping duties, which led to confusion and frustration. Recognizing the tension, I initiated a mediation session where I first listened to each individuals concerns separately to fully understand their perspectives without bias.After gathering insights, I brought them together for a joint discussion. My approach was to foster a collaborative environment, emphasizing shared goals over individual grievances. By guiding the conversation towards a solution-focused dialogue, we identified the root cause of the overlap and collaboratively developed a clear delineation of responsibilities. I also introduced a regular check-in system to prevent similar issues in the future.The outcome was twofold: the immediate conflict was resolved, allowing the project to proceed without further delay, and the team members reported an increased sense of clarity and cooperation in their roles. This intervention not only restored harmony but also strengthened our communication protocols, enhancing overall team efficiency and morale.9. Detail a scenario where you successfully persuaded someone to see things your way at work.Serving as the driving force behind collaboration, buy-in, and the successful implementation of ideas, persuasion is a subtle art in the workplace. The ability to persuade reflects a candidates emotional intelligence, understanding of human behavior, strategic thinking, and communication skills. It also suggests an individuals capacity for empathy, as effective persuasion typically involves recognizing and appealing to others emotions, values, and needs. When responding to this question, you should recount a specific instance that showcases your persuasive skills in a positive light. Describe the situation succinctly, focusing on the conflicting viewpoints involved. Explain your approach to the conversation, highlighting how you listened and understood the other persons perspective before presenting your own. Detail the steps you took to find common ground and how you aligned your proposal with the other partys interests or values. Conclude by sharing the successful outcome and, if relevant, the positive impact it had on the work environment or project success.Example: In a recent project, my team faced a critical decision about adopting a new software platform. While I advocated for a more innovative, albeit less familiar system that promised greater long-term benefits, my colleague favored a more established, traditional option. Understanding the importance of alignment, I initiated a dialogue to explore our respective positions. I listened attentively to my colleagues concerns about the learning curve and potential disruptions, demonstrating empathy and validating their perspective.To persuade them, I prepared a comprehensive comparison of both platforms, highlighting how the innovative systems scalability and advanced features aligned with our companys strategic goals for efficiency and growth. I also proposed a phased implementation plan to mitigate the learning curve concerns. By aligning my argument with our shared objectives and offering a concrete solution to address their apprehensions, I was able to sway my colleagues opinion. The decision to adopt the new platform led to a 30 increase in project efficiency after a successful rollout, validating the effectiveness of the persuasive approach and collaborative decision-making.10. How do you balance assertiveness and diplomacy in team discussions?Navigating team discussions where diverse perspectives and potential conflicts can arise requires a harmonious blend of assertiveness and diplomacy. Assertiveness helps you to articulate your viewpoint clearly and stand your ground, while diplomacy allows you to do so without offending others or escalating tension. Employers seek candidates who can demonstrate these traits, ensuring that they can contribute effectively to team objectives while maintaining a positive and collaborative work environment.When responding to this question, reflect on specific instances where youve successfully managed this balance. Describe a situation where you had to advocate for your ideas or the needs of a project while also considering the opinions and feelings of your colleagues. Explain the strategies you used to communicate your points, such as active listening, acknowledging different perspectives, and finding common ground. Highlight the outcome of the discussion and any positive feedback you received, showcasing your ability to be both a team player and a decisive contributor. Example: In balancing assertiveness and diplomacy during team discussions, I employ a strategy that hinges on active listening and empathetic communication. For instance, when advocating for a particular project direction that I strongly believe in, I first ensure I fully understand the perspectives of my colleagues by asking clarifying questions and summarizing their points to confirm comprehension. This approach not only demonstrates respect for their viewpoints but also allows me to tailor my arguments in a way that addresses their concerns.Once Ive laid the groundwork for a respectful dialogue, I present my case with clear, evidence-based reasoning, ensuring that my tone conveys confidence without bordering on aggression. In situations where consensus is challenging, I strive to identify common objectives and propose solutions that incorporate elements from multiple suggestions, thereby fostering a collaborative environment. This method has consistently yielded positive outcomes, with team members feeling heard and valued, and projects moving forward with a unified vision that integrates the strengths of diverse ideas.11. Describe a moment when you had to motivate a disengaged team member.Engaging a disengaged team member is a delicate task that requires a deep understanding of individual motivations and team dynamics.

Be honest about the challenges faced and the lessons learned, as these insights can further demonstrate your growth and effectiveness as a team leader.Example: In one instance, I noticed a team members participation levels had significantly decreased, and their usual enthusiasm was absent. Recognizing these signs of disengagement, I arranged a private meeting to open a dialogue and understand their perspective. Through active listening, I learned that they felt their skills were underutilized, leading to a lack of fulfillment in their role.To address this, I collaborated with them to identify opportunities that aligned with their interests and expertise, integrating these into their responsibilities. This not only reignited their motivation but also brought fresh insights to the team. The outcome was a marked improvement in their engagement and performance, which had a ripple effect, enhancing team morale and productivity. This experience underscored the importance of personalized motivation strategies and the value of investing time in understanding individual team members needs.12. Share an instance where cultural differences influenced your communication strategy.

Recognizing this, I shifted to a more nuanced approach, carefully framing my language to be more inclusive and less assertive. I also increased my use of metaphors and analogies common in their cultures to convey complex ideas in a relatable manner.To ensure clarity and prevent miscommunication, I began to incorporate more visual aids and written summaries to complement verbal explanations, allowing team members to process information in their preferred format. This strategy not only improved the teams efficiency but also fostered a more inclusive environment that respected and valued cultural diversity. The result was a significant enhancement in collaboration, with the team successfully delivering the project on time, and team members expressing greater satisfaction with the communication process.13.

To address this, I implemented a more robust project management strategy, incorporating buffer times and more realistic milestones. This not only improved my project delivery times but also enhanced team trust in the timelines I set. The experience reinforced the value of embracing criticism as a catalyst for professional development and operational excellence.15.

This involves analyzing their past performance, soliciting feedback from colleagues, and sometimes directly discussing their comfort levels with certain types of tasks. I then align tasks with individual strengths, ensuring that each person is both challenged and equipped to succeed, while also considering their opportunity for growth in areas where they are less strong. I communicate clearly defined expectations and the rationale behind task assignments to foster transparency and buy-in. This is coupled with setting measurable goals and providing the necessary resources and support to achieve them. I maintain an open-door policy for guidance and feedback, which helps in adjusting workloads and reassigning tasks if necessary, to maintain productivity without overburdening any individual.An example of this approach in action was when I assigned a critical project to a team member who had shown potential but lacked experience in that particular area. By providing a clear framework and regular check-ins, the team member not only excelled in the task but also gained valuable skills. This strategic delegation resulted in the successful completion of the project ahead of schedule and contributed to the team members professional growth, demonstrating the effectiveness of matching tasks to both strengths and developmental needs.20.

I facilitated the conversation by asking questions that highlighted the common ground and objectives we shared. By encouraging open communication and actively listening to each viewpoint, I guided the team towards a compromise that combined the strengths of both approaches. This action not only resolved the conflict but also fostered a more innovative and versatile solution.As a result, the team was able to proceed with a unified strategy that enhanced the projects success. The resolution led to a stronger sense of collaboration and trust among team members, and we completed the project ahead of schedule with exceptional results. The experience reinforced the value of embracing diverse perspectives and the importance of constructive conflict resolution in achieving team goals.5. What strategies do you employ when integrating new members into an existing team?Fostering an inclusive environment that minimizes disruption when integrating new members into an established team is pivotal for maintaining productivity and team harmony. This question allows you to showcase your proactive approach that acknowledges the individual strengths of new members while aligning these with the teams culture and objectives.When responding to this question, its essential to highlight specific tactics such as arranging one-on-one introductions, involving new members in team projects right away, and setting clear expectations. Discuss the importance of providing mentorship and feedback during the initial phase and creating opportunities for new members to showcase their skills. Its also beneficial to mention any past experiences where you successfully integrated newcomers and how this positively impacted the teams performance and morale.Example: When integrating new members into an existing team, I prioritize creating a welcoming and inclusive environment that fosters immediate engagement and connection. I start with personalized introductions to establish rapport between the new member and existing team members. This involves not only formal introductions but also facilitating informal social interactions, which can help build camaraderie and trust.I then ensure that new members are quickly involved in team projects, assigning tasks that play to their strengths while also challenging them to grow. This approach not only helps them feel valued for their unique contributions but also accelerates their learning curve within the teams dynamic. Simultaneously, I set clear expectations regarding team goals, individual roles, and the standard of communication required. To support their integration, I pair them with a mentor who can provide guidance, answer questions, and offer constructive feedback. This mentorship is crucial for nurturing their development and ensuring they have the resources to succeed. Through this strategy, Ive observed that new members become productive and harmonious additions to the team, contributing to enhanced overall performance and morale.6. Can you provide an instance where you had to take the lead on a team project unexpectedly? Stepping into leadership roles when they unexpectedly become vacant tests your flexibility, initiative, and leadership skills. This question reveals your ability to guide a team through unforeseen challenges and your capacity for strategic thinking and problem-solving.When responding, candidates should recount a specific scenario that showcases their leadership abilities. They should describe the situation with enough detail to set the context, explain the actions they took to assume the leadership role, and discuss the outcomes of the project. Highlighting their thought process during this time, how they communicated with the team, and any particular strategies they employed to ensure the projects success will illustrate their competence in navigating such situations.Example: Certainly. In one instance, a project was at risk of missing critical deadlines due to the sudden departure of the team leader. Recognizing the urgency, I stepped in to fill the leadership vacuum. I immediately convened a meeting to reassure the team and to redistribute the workload effectively. My first action was to reassess the project timeline and resources, ensuring that each team member understood their revised responsibilities and the importance of their contribution to meeting our new targets.I fostered an environment of open communication, encouraging the team to voice any concerns and collaborate on problem-solving. By establishing daily check-ins, I was able to monitor progress closely and provide support where needed. This approach not only kept the project on track but also maintained team morale during a potentially disruptive transition. Ultimately, our ability to adapt and work cohesively resulted in delivering the project on time and to the satisfaction of our stakeholders, demonstrating our teams resilience and my capacity to lead under unexpected circumstances.7. Detail a time when you sacrificed your own interest for the greater good of the team.Putting aside personal ambitions or preferences for the collective benefit of the group is a testament to your capacity for selflessness, collaboration, and prioritization of team objectives over individual gain. This question allows you to discuss your understanding of the interplay between personal contribution and team success.Responding to this question, candidates should recount a specific instance where they made a conscious decision to forgo their own interests. They should clearly articulate the situation, the potential personal benefit they relinquished, the needs or goals of the team, and the outcome of their sacrifice. It is crucial to emphasize the thought process behind the decision, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of team success and showcasing their role as a collaborative and supportive team player.Example: In a recent project, I was tasked with leading a segment that aligned closely with my personal expertise and promised significant visibility within the organization. However, as the project progressed, it became clear that another team members skills were better suited for this particular aspect due to unforeseen technical challenges. Recognizing the importance of the projects success over my individual recognition, I proposed to management that this colleague take over the lead role for that segment. This decision meant relinquishing a prime opportunity to showcase my abilities, but it was evident that the team and the project would benefit from this realignment. The outcome was a testament to the power of putting the team first: the project was completed with a level of excellence that might not have been achieved otherwise, and the teams morale was boosted by the collaborative spirit. This experience reinforced my belief that the collective success of the team ultimately leads to individual growth and recognition.8. How do you manage to stay productive and maintain high standards during collaborative tasks?Balancing personal productivity with collective goals is crucial for effective team collaboration. This question is not just about getting the work done; its about how you integrate your efforts with the team to achieve high-quality results.When responding, emphasize your strategies for maintaining focus and quality in team settings, such as setting personal benchmarks, actively seeking feedback, and being open to adjusting your approach based on the teams needs. Highlight how you communicate effectively with team members to align on goals, divide tasks logically, and support each other throughout the project. Share specific examples of times youve contributed to a teams success while upholding your own high standards of work.Example: In collaborative tasks, my approach to maintaining productivity and high standards is rooted in clear communication and a shared vision. At the outset of any team project, I ensure that we collectively establish our goals and benchmarks, which provides a roadmap for both individual and group efforts. This alignment is critical for me to set personal milestones that not only contribute to the teams objectives but also uphold my own standards of excellence.As the project progresses, I actively engage with team members to assess our progress and recalibrate if necessary. This involves seeking and providing constructive feedback to refine our strategies and outputs continually. I also prioritize transparency in my work, making it accessible for peer review and collaboration, which helps in maintaining quality and efficiency. For instance, in a recent project, this approach allowed us to identify a bottleneck early on and redistribute tasks to optimize our workflow, ultimately enhancing our overall productivity and the quality of our deliverable.9. Whats your approach to ensuring all voices are heard in a diverse team environment?Gauging your interpersonal skills and commitment to inclusivity, this question probes how you foster collaboration within a diverse group, ensuring that every team member feels valued and heard.Start by acknowledging the importance of diversity in driving innovation and performance. Then, share a specific strategy or example from your experience where you actively encouraged participation from all team members. Perhaps you implemented regular brainstorming sessions where each person could contribute ideas, or maybe you established an anonymous feedback system to ensure even the most introverted voices were considered. Example: In a diverse team setting, I prioritize creating an inclusive atmosphere where each member feels valued and empowered to contribute. One approach Ive found effective is to facilitate structured brainstorming sessions, ensuring that everyone has a designated time to speak without interruption. This method not only respects individual speaking styles but also mitigates the dominance of more extroverted personalities, allowing for a rich tapestry of perspectives to emerge.Additionally, I supplement these sessions with an anonymous feedback mechanism, which serves as a platform for those who may be less comfortable voicing their thoughts in a group setting. By regularly reviewing and addressing this feedback, I make certain that all insights are integrated into our decision-making process. This dual strategy has consistently resulted in more innovative solutions and a heightened sense of ownership across the team, as every member knows their voice has the power to influence the outcome.10. Outline a scenario where you helped a struggling team member succeed.Understanding your approach to fostering a collaborative environment, your ability to identify a colleagues challenges, and your initiative in offering support are key aspects employers look for. This demonstrates your empathy, interpersonal skills, and commitment to the teams collective success.When responding, articulate a specific instance where you recognized a team members difficulties.

Recognizing this as a potential sign of underlying issues, I approached the situation with empathy, initiating a private conversation to understand their challenges. Through active listening, I learned that they were grappling with a complex component of the project, feeling overwhelmed by the technical aspects which were outside their core expertise.I offered to share some of my own strategies for managing similar tasks and provided a mini-workshop on the particular tool that was causing the difficulty. Additionally, I suggested a temporary reassignment of tasks within the team to play to everyones strengths, which was agreed upon in a team meeting. This allowed the team member to focus on areas where they excelled, while also giving them the space to develop their skills without the pressure of immediate deadlines.The result was a noticeable improvement in their confidence and performance.

Its crucial to convey that you value teamwork and collective goals over individual opinions when necessary.Example: In one instance, my team was deciding on the approach for a critical project phase, and I believed that the proposed strategy overlooked potential risks that could derail our timeline. I voiced my concerns during a team meeting, presenting data and past case studies that supported my perspective. My approach was to foster a constructive dialogue, focusing on the projects success rather than proving my point.Despite my input, the team decided to proceed with the original plan. I respected the collective decision and worked diligently to mitigate any risks I had identified. To ensure alignment and maintain team cohesion, I requested regular check-ins to monitor our progress against the potential risks. This proactive communication allowed us to address issues promptly and reinforced the importance of considering diverse viewpoints in team decisions.12. What steps do you take to keep yourself accountable in a team setting?Demonstrating accountability within a team is a reflection of professionalism, self-awareness, and commitment to the teams success.

Its also beneficial to include an example from your past experience where you successfully mediated a disagreement, highlighting the positive outcome that resulted from your intervention.Example: In mediating a situation where two team members have incompatible ideas, I would start by actively listening to each persons perspective, ensuring they feel heard and understood. Its crucial to create an environment where both parties can express their thoughts without interruption, which helps in diffusing tension and building mutual respect. After gathering all the relevant information, I would identify the underlying objectives behind each idea, as this often reveals common goals that might not be immediately apparent.Next, I would facilitate a discussion focused on these shared objectives, encouraging the team members to explore how elements of each idea could be integrated into a cohesive solution. This collaborative approach often leads to innovative outcomes that satisfy all parties involved. For example, in a past situation, I successfully guided two colleagues through a similar process, resulting in a hybrid strategy that not only combined the best aspects of their initial proposals but also increased overall team efficiency and project success.

This approach not only aids understanding but also encourages team members from different backgrounds to engage in the conversation without feeling alienated by specialized language.Active listening is central to my communication style, as it allows me to gauge the teams understanding and adjust my approach accordingly. I often pause to ask clarifying questions, inviting team members to express their perspectives or request further explanation. Additionally, I leverage visual aids to support verbal communication, providing a common reference point that can help synthesize complex ideas into tangible concepts. This strategy promotes a collaborative environment where all team members can contribute effectively, fostering a cohesive and productive team dynamic.16.

To navigate this complexity, I initiated a series of strategy meetings to facilitate open communication and ensure every team members perspective was heard and considered. I led the discussions, focusing on identifying common goals and creating a shared understanding of the projects objectives. By actively listening and synthesizing the diverse viewpoints, I helped the team to develop a unified approach that leveraged our collective strengths.During the execution phase, we encountered unforeseen technical obstacles that threatened to derail our timeline. I advocated for a collaborative problem-solving session, where we pooled our knowledge to brainstorm solutions. This not only expedited the resolution process but also fostered a sense of ownership and camaraderie within the team. My proactive stance on communication and collaboration was instrumental in maintaining team morale and momentum, ultimately leading us to successfully complete the project within the original timeframe.17. What techniques do you use to motivate a team facing low morale?Recognizing the importance of morale and possessing the toolkit to elevate it is crucial for any successful organization.

For instance, when faced with a tight deadline that required additional hours, I transparently communicated the importance of the project to the companys success, fostering a sense of shared purpose. I then distributed the workload equitably and incorporated team members preferences and expertise into task assignments, ensuring that each individual could contribute meaningfully while also feeling valued and engaged.During this process, I also remained attentive to the teams feedback and well-being. By maintaining an open dialogue, I was able to address concerns promptly and adjust plans as necessary to mitigate burnout.

My role involved fostering open communication channels among these diverse groups, ensuring that each team was aware of the others constraints and progress.To ensure the team remained focused and cohesive, I initiated regular stand-up meetings to quickly address any emerging issues and align on the project status. I also facilitated brainstorming sessions that integrated different viewpoints, which led to innovative solutions that might not have been discovered in siloed environments. This approach was effective because it leveraged the unique strengths of each department, leading to a product that was well-engineered, aesthetically pleasing, and market-ready. The result was a 20 reduction in time-to-market and a product that exceeded sales forecasts by 15 in its first quarter post-launch, demonstrating the power of cross-functional synergy.20.

This question seeks to understand how a candidate would identify and address such an issue, demonstrating their leadership and empathy. Its about their capacity to re-engage team members and ensure that everyone is contributing effectively to the teams goals.When responding, it is crucial to recount a specific instance where you faced this challenge. Detail your approach in understanding the root cause of the disengagement, whether it was a lack of interest, personal issues, or a mismatch of skills and tasks. Explain the strategies you employed, such as offering support, providing clarity on the teams vision, or realigning their responsibilities to better suit their strengths. Highlight the outcome, focusing on the positive change in the team members performance and the overall team cohesion. Your response should underscore your role as a catalyst for change and an advocate for a supportive, unified team environment.Example: In one instance, I noticed a team members participation and productivity had significantly declined. Recognizing the potential impact on team morale and output, I initiated a private conversation to understand the underlying issues. It became evident that the individual felt their skills were not being effectively utilized, leading to a sense of underappreciation and detachment.To address this, I worked with the individual to identify their strengths and interests, and together we mapped out tasks that would be more engaging for them. I also ensured they understood how their work contributed to the teams goals, reinforcing the value of their contributions. This approach not only reinvigorated their motivation but also demonstrated my commitment to aligning team roles with personal strengths for the benefit of the collective objective.The result was a noticeable improvement in the team members engagement and productivity. This shift had a ripple effect, enhancing team dynamics and overall performance. By investing time in understanding and acting on the team members concerns, I was able to foster a more cohesive and motivated team environment.5. In what ways have you fostered a collaborative environment among diverse individuals? In todays diverse workplaces, creating a collaborative environment is essential for leveraging a variety of perspectives and achieving innovative solutions. This question assesses a candidates ability to unite people with different backgrounds and viewpoints towards common goals, and to ensure that all team members feel valued and are able to contribute.When responding, candidates should share specific examples of when theyve brought together individuals from varied backgrounds to work on a project or solve a problem. They might discuss strategies theyve used to ensure all voices are heard, such as structured brainstorming sessions or assigning roles that play to each persons strengths. Its also effective to mention any tools or activities implemented to enhance team communication and trust, demonstrating a proactive approach to fostering inclusivity and cooperation.Example: To foster a collaborative environment among diverse individuals, I have always prioritized open communication and inclusivity. For instance, I initiated structured brainstorming sessions where each team member was given equal time to voice their ideas and perspectives. This approach not only democratized the ideation process but also ensured that we leveraged the diverse thought processes within the team, leading to innovative solutions.Understanding that collaboration extends beyond meetings, I implemented a rotation system for project leads, allowing team members to step into leadership roles that align with their unique strengths and expertise. This not only empowered individuals but also fostered a sense of ownership and respect across the team. Additionally, I integrated collaboration tools that facilitated seamless communication and project management, ensuring that all team members, regardless of location or background, could contribute effectively and feel connected to the collective goal. Through these methods, the team consistently demonstrated improved performance and a high level of engagement in our projects.6. Detail a scenario where you mediated a conflict between team members.Navigating team conflicts with diplomacy and emotional intelligence is a sought-after skill, as it preserves team cohesion and productivity. This question tests a candidates ability to mediate disputes, which is a strong indicator of their communication skills, empathy, and potential for leadership.When responding, recount a specific instance where you successfully mediated a conflict. Describe the steps you took to understand each partys viewpoint, the strategies you used to find common ground, and how you facilitated a collaborative resolution. Emphasize your active listening skills, your impartial approach, and the positive outcomes that resulted from the resolution, such as improved team dynamics or a project back on track.Example: In a recent project, two key team members reached an impasse over the direction of a critical component, with each committed to their divergent strategies. Recognizing the potential for this conflict to derail our progress, I stepped in to mediate. Initially, I conducted one-on-one discussions with each individual to fully understand their perspectives and concerns, ensuring confidentiality and demonstrating active listening to validate their positions. Following this, I facilitated a joint session where both parties could communicate their viewpoints in a structured and respectful environment. I employed the interest-based relational approach, steering the conversation away from personal stances and towards the underlying interests and project goals that both shared. By keeping the dialogue focused on common objectives and the teams success, we collaboratively developed a hybrid strategy that incorporated elements from both proposals. This not only resolved the conflict but also led to a more innovative solution that significantly enhanced the projects outcome. The process reinforced trust within the team and underscored the value of collective problem-solving.7. Provide an example of how youve managed a high-performing teams expectations and goals.Setting ambitious yet realistic goals is a key aspect of managing a high-performing team. This question looks for insights into a candidates leadership style, their alignment of team members with company objectives, and their ability to maintain high standards without causing burnout.When responding, focus on a specific instance where you led a team to achieve outstanding results. Discuss how you collaborated with the team to set clear, challenging goals, monitored progress, and provided support and resources. Highlight how you communicated with the team, celebrated milestones, and managed any stress or conflicts that arose. Emphasize the outcomes, the lessons learned, and how the experience has shaped your approach to leadership.Example: In managing a high-performing team, I employed a strategic approach to align the teams expectations and goals with our overarching objectives. We began by collaboratively establishing clear, ambitious targets that were both measurable and attainable, ensuring each team member understood their role in achieving these goals. Regular check-ins were scheduled to monitor our progress, discuss any challenges, and adjust our strategies as necessary. This continuous dialogue allowed us to remain agile and responsive to changing circumstances.To maintain momentum and morale, I made it a priority to recognize individual and team milestones, providing positive reinforcement and celebrating our successes. When conflicts or stress arose, I facilitated solution-focused discussions to address issues head-on, fostering a culture of open communication and mutual support. This proactive approach to conflict resolution helped to sustain team cohesion and performance. The outcome was not only the achievement of our goals but also the development of a resilient team dynamic that could withstand future challenges. This experience reinforced the importance of adaptability, clear communication, and recognition in leading high-performing teams.8. What methods do you use to track and evaluate team performance?Continuous improvement of team dynamics and outcomes is a hallmark of successful team management. This question probes a candidates systematic approach to monitoring performance, setting clear benchmarks, and implementing feedback mechanisms that drive progress, while balancing quantitative data with qualitative insights. When responding, outline a structured approach that includes setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals, regular check-ins, and employing both data-driven tools (like project management software) and interpersonal strategies (such as one-on-ones) for gauging performance. Emphasize how you align individual contributions with team objectives, and how you use these evaluations to celebrate successes, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate professional development within your team.Example: To track and evaluate team performance effectively, I employ a blend of quantitative and qualitative methods. Initially, I ensure that the teams objectives are aligned with SMART goals, which provides a clear framework for measuring progress. Utilizing project management software, I can monitor these metrics in real-time, which allows for prompt identification of any deviations from the planned trajectory.In parallel, I conduct regular check-ins with team members, fostering an open dialogue that encourages self-assessment and reflection on both individual and team levels. These discussions are invaluable for understanding the nuances behind the numbers, such as team dynamics and individual well-being, which can significantly impact performance. The insights gained from these conversations are then synthesized with the data to provide a comprehensive view of the teams performance. This dual approach not only helps in celebrating successes and pinpointing areas for growth but also informs targeted professional development initiatives, ensuring continuous improvement and team cohesion.9. Recall a time when you led a project with tight deadlines; how did you keep the team on track?Leadership, organization, and motivational skills are put to the test when maintaining team momentum and cohesion under pressure. This question highlights candidates who can strategically plan and execute tasks, delegate effectively, and sustain team morale, especially when facing tight deadlines.To respond, outline a specific instance where you led a project under tight deadlines. Detail your approach to task delegation, how you prioritized work, and the methods you used to keep the team informed and motivated. Demonstrate your ability to anticipate challenges and adapt plans accordingly. Its important to show that you maintained open communication, provided support where needed, and recognized the efforts of your team members, all of which contributed to the successful and timely completion of the project.Example: In leading a project with a tight deadline, I initiated by setting clear, prioritized goals and breaking down the project into manageable tasks. I then matched these tasks with team members strengths and availability, ensuring an efficient workflow. To keep everyone on track, I implemented daily stand-up meetings, which served as a platform for progress updates, identifying roadblocks, and real-time problem-solving. These brief yet focused meetings fostered a collaborative environment and kept the momentum going. Anticipating potential delays, I maintained a flexible yet focused approach to project management. This involved regularly revisiting and adjusting our strategy to align with evolving circumstances without losing sight of the deadline. I also made sure to celebrate small victories, which kept morale high and motivated the team to maintain their pace. Through open communication and strategic task management, we not only met the deadline but also delivered a high-quality outcome that resonated with our project objectives.10. How do you balance individual recognition with team achievements?Recognizing individual efforts within a team is about maintaining a balance that ensures members feel valued for their unique contributions while fostering a sense of collective achievement. This question explores the candidates ability to inspire a collaborative spirit without causing rivalry or resentment among team members.When responding, it is crucial to articulate a philosophy that values both individual and team contributions. Candidates should provide examples of how they have celebrated personal milestones in a way that contributes to team cohesion and spirit. Discuss strategies like giving shout-outs during meetings for individual efforts while also highlighting how these efforts contributed to the teams goals. This shows an appreciation for the individual while reinforcing the importance of the teams collective success.Example: Balancing individual recognition with team achievements requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the unique contributions of each member while reinforcing the collective effort. In practice, I ensure that individual milestones are celebrated in the context of the teams goals. For instance, when a team member exceeds expectations or demonstrates exceptional skill, I give them a shout-out in team meetings, emphasizing how their contributions have advanced our shared objectives. This not only validates the individuals effort but also serves as a motivational catalyst for the entire team, fostering a culture of excellence and collaboration.Simultaneously, I integrate team achievements into our narrative of success, making it clear that while individual talents are the building blocks, it is the synergy of these talents that leads to our most significant accomplishments. This dual focus helps maintain a balance where individuals feel seen and appreciated, yet completely in sync with the teams mission. By doing so, we create an environment where personal growth and team progress are inextricably linked, driving us towards our collective aspirations.11. Describe a creative solution you facilitated as a result of team brainstorming.Driving effective collaboration within a team is a key component of a candidates ability to lead and generate results. This question assesses their leadership within a team context, their comfort with collective idea generation, and their skill in harnessing the groups creative power. To respond, recount a specific instance where you played a pivotal role in guiding a teams brainstorming session. Detail the challenge at hand, the diversity of ideas presented, and how you encouraged open dialogue and critical thinking. Highlight how you helped navigate the team through the ideation process and how you collectively refined a particular idea into an actionable and successful solution. Its crucial to emphasize your role in facilitating the teams creativity, ensuring that credit is shared, and demonstrating the positive impact of the collaborative effort.Example: In a recent project, we faced a significant challenge in optimizing our workflow to meet an aggressive deadline. The team was diverse, with members from various departments, each bringing their own perspective to the table. During our brainstorming session, I encouraged an environment where every idea was valued and considered. To facilitate this, I introduced a round-robin approach, where each team member had the floor to present their ideas without interruption, ensuring equal participation.One team member suggested a novel approach to automate a portion of our process that was traditionally done manually. This idea initially seemed too ambitious given our time constraints. However, recognizing the potential efficiency gains, I guided the team through a structured evaluation of the idea, breaking it down into actionable steps. We collectively assessed the feasibility, resources required, and the potential risks involved. By fostering an open dialogue and critical thinking, we were able to refine the concept and develop a prototype within a short period. This creative solution not only allowed us to meet our deadline but also set a new standard for future projects, demonstrating the power of team-oriented brainstorming when effectively facilitated.12. Tell us about a moment you took initiative in a group setting without formal authority.Taking initiative in a group setting showcases a candidates leadership potential and their ability to act without formal authority. It highlights their comfort with ambiguity, their drive for results, and their collaborative mindset, which are crucial for team-oriented environments.When responding, focus on a specific instance that illustrates your proactive approach. Describe the situation, the actions you took, and the positive outcomes that resulted. Emphasize how you communicated with your team to gain buy-in and how your initiative aligned with the groups goals. Your answer should demonstrate your ability to contribute meaningfully without overstepping, showing respect for your colleagues and an understanding of when to lead and when to support.Example: In a group setting, I recognized a critical bottleneck that was hindering our progress. The project was complex, involving multiple departments, and the communication between these units was inefficient, delaying decision-making. Understanding the urgency, I proposed an inter-departmental meeting to streamline our communication process. I reached out to key stakeholders from each team to discuss the idea and, after gaining their support, I organized a collaborative session. During the meeting, I facilitated a solution-focused discussion, encouraging open communication and ensuring that everyones voice was heard. We collectively developed a new communication protocol that leveraged our diverse expertise while minimizing delays. This initiative not only expedited the project timeline but also fostered a stronger sense of teamwork and understanding among the departments. The success of this approach was evident in the improved project metrics and the positive feedback from team members, who felt more connected and engaged in the projects success.13. How would you integrate a new member into an already established team?Integrating new members into a team is essential for maintaining harmony and efficiency. This question assesses a candidates understanding of team cohesion and their strategies for creating an inclusive environment that supports collaboration.To respond, outline a clear plan that demonstrates your awareness of team dynamics. Start by emphasizing the importance of introducing the new member to the teams culture and values. Explain how you would facilitate introductions, ensure the new member has a mentor or point of contact, and involve them in team meetings and projects right from the start. Mention how you would monitor the teams interaction and provide feedback to both the new member and the existing team to ensure a smooth transition. Highlight any experiences youve had with this process in the past, and how your actions helped to quickly and effectively integrate new members into the team.Example: Integrating a new member into an established team requires a strategic approach that respects the existing teams culture while fostering inclusivity. Initially, I would introduce the new member to the teams core values and objectives, ensuring they understand the teams vision and how their role contributes to our collective goals. This sets a foundation for their sense of purpose and belonging.Next, I would arrange for a seasoned team member to act as a mentor, offering guidance and serving as a reliable point of contact. This mentorship is pivotal for navigating the nuances of team dynamics and work processes. Concurrently, I would involve the new member in ongoing projects and team meetings, encouraging active participation to facilitate organic relationship-building and collaboration. This hands-on involvement accelerates their understanding of team workflows and allows them to demonstrate their skills and insights, which is essential for mutual trust.Monitoring the teams interactions is crucial; I would provide constructive feedback to both the new member and the team to promote open communication and address any concerns promptly. From experience, this proactive engagement not only ensures the new member integrates effectively but also reinforces the teams adaptability and cohesion, ultimately enhancing our collective performance.14. What techniques have you used to manage remote or distributed teams effectively?The unique challenges of managing remote or distributed teams require specific skills and strategies. This question delves into a candidates experience with virtual team dynamics, their use of technology, and their methods for ensuring productivity and engagement from afar. When responding, highlight specific tools and platforms youve utilized for project management and communication, such as Asana, Slack, or Zoom. Discuss your approach to regular check-ins, setting clear expectations, and how you maintain a sense of team culture and connection. Emphasize your commitment to transparency and how you handle performance tracking and feedback in a remote setting. If youve implemented innovative solutions or team-building activities, share those experiences to demonstrate your proactive approach to remote team management.Example: In managing remote or distributed teams, Ive leveraged a combination of project management and communication platforms like Asana for task tracking and Slack for real-time messaging, ensuring that the team has a clear view of priorities and deadlines. Ive found that integrating these tools with a shared calendar and regular video conferencing through Zoom helps maintain a structured yet flexible workflow, accommodating different time zones and work styles.To foster a cohesive team culture, Ive instituted weekly check-ins and monthly virtual team-building activities, which serve as a forum for both professional alignment and personal connection. This regular cadence of communication is complemented by a transparent approach to performance tracking, utilizing dashboards within project management software to provide visibility on individual contributions and team progress. Ive also established an open feedback loop, encouraging team members to share their insights and suggestions, which has proven invaluable in refining processes and maintaining high morale.15. Give an instance where you sacrificed personal gain for the teams benefit.Prioritizing the teams success over individual achievements is a trait that distinguishes a collaborative team player. This question probes into the candidates capacity for selflessness and their understanding of the importance of the teams collective objectives.When responding, provide a specific example that demonstrates a clear understanding of the teams needs and how your actions supported those needs. Explain the situation, the potential personal gain you set aside, and how your decision benefited the team. Its important to articulate the thought process behind your action and the positive impact it had on the teams performance or morale. This response should affirm your commitment to collaborative success and show that you are a candidate who values the common good over personal gain.Example: In one project, I was presented with an opportunity to lead a high-profile segment that would have significantly increased my visibility within the organization. However, I recognized that another team member had a unique skill set that was perfectly suited for this task, one that would likely lead to a more successful outcome for the team as a whole. After careful consideration, I proposed to management that this colleague take the lead on the segment, effectively stepping back from the spotlight to ensure the teams success. This decision meant foregoing a chance to showcase my own abilities on a larger stage, but it was clear that leveraging my teammates expertise would not only enhance the projects quality but also foster a more collaborative team environment. The result was a highly praised deliverable and a strengthened team dynamic that led to increased efficiency and effectiveness in subsequent projects. My choice to prioritize the teams needs over personal recognition exemplified my commitment to our collective goals and demonstrated an understanding that the teams success is ultimately my success as well.16. When have you challenged a popular opinion within a team, and why?Asserting a differing viewpoint in a team setting is a delicate balance that tests your critical thinking and diplomacy. This question seeks to understand how a candidate respects group consensus while also valuing their own convictions, potentially influencing the teams direction for the better.When responding, recount a specific instance where you respectfully presented a counterargument to a widely accepted idea. Outline the reasoning behind your challenge and how you communicated it to your colleagues. Detail the outcome, emphasizing the impact of your intervention on the teams decision-making process and the final result. Highlight the skills you used, such as persuasion, analytical thinking, and empathy, to ensure your perspective was considered without alienating team members.Example: In a team setting, I once challenged the prevailing opinion regarding the direction of a project that was heavily favored due to its perceived simplicity and lower initial costs. My counterargument was based on a thorough cost-benefit analysis which highlighted the long-term inefficiencies and potential scalability issues associated with the popular choice. I presented my findings during a team meeting, ensuring that I communicated the data clearly and respectfully, acknowledging the merits of the popular opinion while also illustrating the potential pitfalls that had not been fully considered.The outcome of my intervention was a shift in the teams perspective. After a robust discussion, we collectively decided to explore a hybrid approach, integrating elements from both the popular opinion and my proposal. This led to a more sustainable and scalable solution that proved beneficial in the long run. My approach relied on a combination of analytical thinking to dissect the problem and persuasive communication to convey the findings, all while maintaining a collegial atmosphere that fostered open dialogue and constructive feedback.17. How do you assess the skills gap in a team and act upon it?Addressing skill gaps within a team is crucial for maintaining efficiency and competitiveness. This question looks at whether a candidate can identify areas where the team is lacking and take proactive measures to enhance overall performance. When responding to this question, first, outline a systematic approach to assessing skills, such as regular performance reviews, team meetings, or using skill matrix tools. Then, discuss how you prioritize which gaps to address based on the teams objectives and the impact on workflow. Mention any relevant experience where youve successfully identified a skills gap and taken steps to close it, such as organizing training sessions, mentoring, or recruiting new talent with the necessary expertise. Illustrate your ability to foster a culture of continuous improvement and learning within the team.Example: To assess a skills gap within a team, I implement a multifaceted approach that includes analyzing performance metrics, soliciting feedback during team meetings, and utilizing competency frameworks or skill matrices. This allows me to identify not only where the gaps exist but also understand their implications on our collective performance and objectives. I prioritize addressing these gaps by considering the urgency of the need and the potential for improvement in productivity or quality of work.Once identified, I act upon these gaps through targeted strategies. For instance, if a gap is due to a lack of knowledge in a new technology, I might arrange for specialized training or workshops. Alternatively, if the gap is more nuanced, such as a deficiency in soft skills like leadership or communication, I might initiate a mentoring program or provide opportunities for team members to develop these skills in a supportive environment. My focus is always on aligning the teams skill set with our strategic goals, thereby fostering a culture of continuous professional development and adaptability.18. Illustrate a time when you had to rely heavily on teamwork to solve a complex problem.Understanding the value of collaboration and having a history of engaging in it to solve problems is what employers look for. This question reveals if a candidate can effectively work with others, integrate diverse perspectives, and utilize the groups collective skills to overcome complex challenges.When responding to this question, focus on a specific instance that clearly demonstrates your role within a team setting. Outline the problem, describe the group dynamics, and detail the actions taken collectively. Emphasize your ability to listen, integrate feedback, and adapt to the groups needs. Highlight your interpersonal skills, flexibility, and any leadership role you might have taken to facilitate the teams success. Conclude with the outcome, reflecting on what you learned from the experience and how it has shaped your approach to teamwork.Example: In a previous project, we faced a critical challenge when a key component of our system failed, threatening to derail our timeline. The complexity of the issue required a multidisciplinary approach, and as such, we formed a task force with members from software development, quality assurance, and customer support teams. Recognizing the urgency, we convened to brainstorm potential solutions, openly sharing insights and expertise. I took the initiative to facilitate the discussions, ensuring that each team members voice was heard and valued. By fostering an environment of collaboration, we were able to synthesize our diverse perspectives into a coherent action plan. We divided responsibilities based on each members strengths, with developers addressing the technical aspects, QA testing the robustness of our solutions, and customer support preparing communication strategies for stakeholders.The outcome was a testament to the power of teamwork; not only did we resolve the issue ahead of our revised schedule, but we also established a more resilient system and improved our interdepartmental communication processes. This experience reinforced my belief in the synergy of a well-coordinated team and honed my ability to lead through listening, integrating feedback, and driving collective action towards a common goal.19. What is your method for ensuring accountability in a team setting?Ensuring accountability within a team is fundamental for the successful completion of tasks and projects. This question examines a candidates strategies for encouraging team members to meet their commitments and contribute to the teams goals, as well as their leadership abilities in addressing underperformance.When responding, focus on specific strategies youve implemented successfully in the past. Detail your approach to setting clear expectations, providing regular feedback, and using tools or systems to track progress. Explain how you encourage open communication and foster an environment where team members feel comfortable holding each other accountable. If relevant, share an example of a time when your approach to accountability led to a positive outcome for a project or team dynamic.Example: In ensuring accountability within a team, I emphasize the establishment of clear, measurable objectives from the outset. This involves collaborative goal-setting where each team members responsibilities are explicitly defined, aligning with the overall project milestones. To maintain transparency and track progress, I utilize project management tools that allow real-time updates and visibility into each members contributions. This system not only serves as a progress indicator but also as a platform for recognition of individual efforts, which is crucial for motivation and accountability.Regular check-ins are a cornerstone of my approach, providing opportunities for feedback and course correction. During these sessions, I encourage open dialogue, allowing the team to address any obstacles proactively. This creates a culture of mutual support where team members feel empowered to hold one another accountable, knowing that the collective success is a shared responsibility. By fostering this environment, Ive witnessed teams Ive worked with overcome complex challenges efficiently, leading to high-quality deliverables and enhanced team cohesion.20. Can you recount a project that required cross-functional collaboration and how you navigated it?Working with diverse teams across departments is often necessary for successful project completion. This question explores a candidates ability to integrate different viewpoints, manage interpersonal skills, and align the team with the projects objectives, overcoming potential conflicts and communication barriers. When responding, focus on a specific project where your role required active collaboration with other departments. Detail how you established communication channels, handled differences in opinion, and ensured all parties were on the same page. Emphasize the strategies you used to foster team unity and the steps you took to keep the project on track. Highlight any challenges faced and how you resolved them, demonstrating your problem-solving skills and ability to lead within a cross-functional team.Example: In a recent project, we were tasked with developing a new product that required input from RD, marketing, sales, and customer service. Recognizing the importance of seamless collaboration, I initiated a series of cross-functional meetings to align our goals and establish clear communication channels. This proactive approach helped to break down silos and fostered a culture of open dialogue, where each department could voice their expertise and concerns.During the development phase, we encountered differing opinions on the products features and target market. I facilitated a solution-focused workshop that allowed each team to present data supporting their perspective, leading to a consensus based on empirical evidence rather than departmental biases. By maintaining a transparent decision-making process and ensuring all voices were heard, we not only resolved the conflict but also strengthened interdepartmental relationships. This collaborative effort was instrumental in launching a product that was well-received in the market, demonstrating the power of cross-functional synergy in driving successful outcomes.Top 20 Contracting Interview Questions AnswersTop 20 Philosophy Interview Questions AnswersYou may also be interested in...Top 20 HR Policy Interview Questions AnswersTop 20 Boxing Interview Questions AnswersTop 20 Classroom Management Interview Questions AnswersTop 20 Stock Market Interview Questions Answers",

Fifty years after the first release, the test resurfaced in a 1974 issue of the Thresher, demonstrating its enduring appeal.A momentous change occurred in 1988 when the test presented an expanded set of 100 questions, a departure from its earlier 10-question format. The years 1998 and 2008 again saw changes in the Rice Purity Test quizzes, of which the 2008 tests questions are considered much cruder than the current version. In 2012, another new version of the test arrived, with 100 yes-or-no questions like we know today. In the same year, 2012, this Rice Purity Test version made its debut online, available at ricepuritytest.com, making the test accessible to a wider audience.Taking the Rice Purity Test is a voluntary opportunity not only for O-week groups at Rice to bond but also for students to track their life experiences and maturation throughout college. But not just a staple of O-Week at Rice, the Rice Purity Test has been widely spread through colleges and even high schools worldwide. Interestingly, online versions of the test have been created and shared widely on the internet, reaching individuals globally and letting them test their life experiences in a playful and fun manner. The watershed moment arrived in 2020 when the Rice Purity Test achieved exceptional virality on the social media platform TikTok.The Rice Purity Test's Cultural InfluenceThe Rice Purity Test has significantly influenced the worlds popular culture, with its popularity shown in different areas like social media, TV shows, movies, and more.These days, the test is considered a famous tool for college students and other groups of people to gauge their degree of innocence and life experiences (of course, in a fun and informal way). Its online versions have been shared widely, especially on giant social platforms like TikTok and Twitter.Due to its widespread popularity, particularly online, multiple variants inspired by the original Rice Purity Test have been created. Some of the most common ones include the Innocent Test, Berkeley Purity Test, and Unofficial Stanford Purity Test, which feature some or many brand-new quizzes while still using the same scoring methods. Some other unofficial versions or variants of the test may include the Rice Purity Test for teens, the Rice Purity Test for virgins, etc.The popularity of the Rice Purity test has also been seen in other areas of popular culture, such as TV shows, movies, and even music. In 2022, the famous Netflix show Big Mouth dedicated a whole episode to this test, named the Rice Purity Test. Have you watched this Big Mouth episode?Controversy Surrounding the Rice Purity TestThe Rice Purity test is, without a doubt, popular among different groups of people, especially the young ones. The test may seem harmless, but it has been criticized and controversial for the following four major reasons:1. Pressure and stigmaRice purity testing may inadvertently promote pressure among people. Individuals with low scores might feel shameful or impure, while those with high scores might feel like they are too prudish or innocent, for example. This may foster stigma or even result in harmful behaviors to change the scores.2. Outdated and harmful notion of puritySome argue that the test may promote an outdated and even harmful notion of purity and impurity. This can lead to shame, guilt, and judgment for individuals having different experiences than what is supposed to be \"pure\" and \"innocent.\"3. The test can make some people uncomfortableThe test, with questions asking personal and sometimes intimate questions about one's life experiences, particularly regarding sexual activities, substance use, and other private behaviors, can make some individuals feel uncomfortable.In addition, Rice Purity testing may also trigger some bad memories or negative emotions for some respondents who had traumatic or bad experiences related to the test quizzes.4. Not accounting for the context of ones experiencesThe test seems to ignore the context and consent of the respondents experiences, like whether they were coerced, forced, or voluntary. Also, the quizzes do not account for factors like culture, religion, and more, which may enormously impact a person's choices and Rice Purity scores.Thats why, again, the Rice Purity Test and its results are intended purely for fun and entertainment purposes. They are not a reliable method to gauge someone's morality, character, or personal value. More importantly, only take the test if you find yourself comfortable with the test questions. Also, we do not recommend this test for too young people.Common Misconceptions About the TestThe Rice Purity Test is a measure of a persons character and morality.It doesnt measure moral character or goodness at all.Theres no correlation between a low or high score and moral inferiority or superiority.The Rice Purity Test is comprehensive and absolute.The test isnt a full evaluation of someones life experiences. It cant cover every potential life experience, for sure.Thats why its said the test isnt a scientific or accurate measure of someone's character or morality.Thus, you shouldnt take it too seriously or use it to judge others and even yourself.The Rice Purity Test is applicable and suitable for everyone.Though the Rice Purity Test has been used worldwide, please note that it was initially designed for freshmen at Rice University. That means the test, with its specific cultural and temporal setting, might not be applicable and suitable for everyone.Statistical Reports of the Rice Test Updated to 2025Below are a few stats that you may want to know:Average Rice Purity ScoreSource: Anonymously from Google AnalyticsAverage Rice Purity Score by Age and GenderSource: Anonymously from Google AnalyticsQuestions with the most Yes answers1.

Is the Rice Purity Test Suitable for All Ages?No. Since the test includes questions about substances, sex, deceit, etc., it may not be suitable for all people, especially for younger ones. Thus, its advisable to take the test if youre aware of the Rice Purity Tests nature and purpose and are comfortable enough to answer 100 test questions honestly and without any judgments.Does the Rice Purity Test Provide Accurate Results?No. The test isnt an accurate and valid measure of the purity or innocence of a person (as well as their morality and character).As it isnt a scientific or psychological assessment, the test results should never be taken as a definitive indicator of someones purity.

    "plain_text": "Pages: 1 Page 1: Thomas test: behavior in conflict. Everyone knows the expression, expressed by Socrates in the 5th century BC, that in a dispute, truth is born. If this statement is applied to the present time, then it can be paraphrased as how truth is born in a discussion or in a dialogue,\r but not infrequently such dialogues lead to conflicts. How to behave correctly in conflict situations in order to achieve your goals with low losses?In psychology, there are five main types of human behavior in conflict situations: rivalry, cooperation, compromise, avoidance and adaptation. Each of these behaviors has both pros and cons. In the early 1970s. Ralph Kilmann and Kenneth Thomas, Ph.D.\r professors of management at the University of Pittsburgh, have developed a method for measuring the severity of five basic types of behavior in interpersonal conflict.On our website is translated into Russian and adapted by N.V. Grishina this technique for the post-Soviet space. The technique has a convenient form of a questionnaire test and includes 30 pairs of statements. In each pair, you must choose the option\r that best suits your views. As a result, after passing the Thomas-Kilmann test, you will find out to which conflict resolution strategy your psychotype is predisposed and what the likelihood is that\r you will win or lose in the conflict. At the same time, do not forget that with any test result - positive or negative for you - you can learn to manage conflicts. The main thing is your desire!P.S. The only way to gain an advantage in an argument is to dodge it.\r ( Dale Carnegie )Thomas test: behavior in conflict.2761.

AI Trust Score:Generates integrity score based on candidates behavior and activity.What is Online Proctoring?Online proctoring refers to the process of supervising candidates remotely during online assessments to ensure fairness and prevent cheating.Traditionally, human invigilators monitored exams physically. But with Xobins AI-driven proctoring, most of the supervision is automated. This means real-time detection of suspicious behavior, multiple devices, or unauthorized actions without intruding on the candidates privacy.Whether youre an HR leader, recruiter, or educator, Xobins proctoring suite guarantees the security and integrity of every online test.Why Xobins AI Proctoring Stands OutUnlike conventional monitoring tools, Xobins proctoring solution offers a multi-layered security approach. It integrates AI algorithms, real-time analytics, and customizable controls, allowing organizations to create the perfect balance between strict invigilation and candidate comfort.Heres how Xobin helps you conduct cheat-proof assessments with AI-powered precision.Key Xobin AI Proctoring Features that Prevent CheatingQuestion Shuffle and RandomizationEvery test session is unique. Xobin automatically randomizes question order and answer options, making it impossible for candidates to predict or share exact sequences. This eliminates collusion and guarantees fairness across multiple test sessions.CutCopyPaste DisablingTo prevent plagiarism and information sharing, Xobin blocks all cut, copy, and paste operations, including keyboard shortcuts. This ensures that candidates cant copy questions or search for answers externally. Right Click disablingRight-click menus are completely disabled during tests, ensuring candidates cant use browser developer tools, inspect elements or open any unauthorized windows.Keystroke Recording in Coding TestsFor coding assessments , Xobin records every keystroke to identify a candidates unique typing pattern. This allows evaluators to verify code originality and detect any external code import.Webcam RecordingXobins webcam proctoring utilizes the built-in microphone and camera functionalities to capture continuous video or periodic snapshots throughout the test. This ensures monitoring real-time behavior of candidates without interrupting the test experience.Off-Tab Activity TrackingXobins off-tab activity tracking feature monitors test-takers behavior to detect any attempt to navigate away from the assessment window. If a candidate attempts to switch tabs or access other applications during the assessment, the system immediately flags any off-tab activity and they are promptly warned about the violation of exam rules.Persistent disregard for warnings may result in disqualification from the exam.PS: Warnings are given to candidates.Absentee DetectionUsing advanced motion analysis, Xobin detects when a candidate leaves their seat or moves out of frame, alerting proctors immediately. This ensures the candidate remains present and attentive during the assessment.Multi-Device DetectionOur system identifies simultaneous device usage, such as smartphones or secondary monitors. Even partially visible devices are detected and flagged, ensuring no external resources are used during the assessment. This feature ensures the assessment remains device-locked and secure.Multiple Users DetectionThe AI proctoring system identifies if more than one person appears in the camera frame. This feature assists HR teams in verifying that the right candidate is genuinely attempting the assessment without external assistance.Screen Recording Browser Activity MonitoringXobin records the entire screen session, capturing every movement and browser tab opened. All browser tabs, window switches, and navigations are tracked in real time. Any attempt to visit external pages or open new windows is instantly flagged.Eye TrackingUsing advanced eye-tracking technology, Xobin monitors gaze direction to detect if the candidate frequently looks away from the screen, a common indicator of external help. Frequent off-screen gazes trigger real-time alerts for potential misconduct.Audio Recording Real-Time AnalysisThrough microphone access, Xobin captures and analyzes background noise, detecting conversations or other forms of unauthorized help. Every sound event is analyzed in real-time by AI for accurate flagging.Secure Browser (XoLock)Xobin offers a secure browser environment that blocks all external applications, pop-ups, and unauthorized access. It restricts 90 of external app access, creating a closed and distraction-free environment.Real-Time Live ProctoringXobin also offers live human proctoring for added security. Trained proctors oversee small candidate batches, ensuring no suspicious behavior goes unnoticed.Plagiarism DetectionXobin scans codes or subjective answers of candidates to detect plagiarism or duplicate content. Detailed proctoring reports help recruiters identify originality of assessment and candidate integrity.Non-Googleable QuestionsThese are custom-built questions which can not be searched on the web, require critical thinking and personal interpretation to answer the question.AI Trust Score Algorithm At the end of each test, Xobins Trust Score evaluates a candidates overall integrity based on multiple proctoring signals. This helps recruiters instantly identify which candidates took the test honestly and which ones might require review.Why Enterprises Choose Xobin for Secure Online AssessmentsXobins AI proctoring system is trusted by enterprises and fast-scaling startups for its ability to deliver secure, fair, and scalable talent assessments.

Copyrights 2026 Quizack.com Page 2: About Us Quizack About UsQuizack provides solutions for tricky interview questions, online IT tests, Mock tests (job assessments), and freelance skill tests.Through different customer interactions, we came to know that they were not able to handle online tests despite having all the latest knowledge. Everyone was claiming about the ambiguous structures and tricky practical terms. So our team of experts started looking at different ways towards providing dynamic solutions against tricky online tests. They have devised the most optimistic system where users could do thorough practice and familiarize themselves with ambiguous structures.Knowing the root causeOur team of experts diagnosed that most of the online or offline tutorials are not up to the mark while providing solutions for the assessments. Some websites are giving outdated tutorials with deprecated topics. Whereas, others are giving simply wrong information in terms of answers or practical terminologies. Moreover, we came across some websites whose content was up to date but they were delivering it through typical PDF or DOC format.On top of that, restricted time limits were making professionals fall short in their assessments.Where the solution liesDuring the initial stages, we assumed that it would be enough if you are familiar with the typical scenarios and knowing the expected answer. But that did not prove to be enough, users fell prey to tricky structuring especially in multiple-choice questions. What we discovered, that it is the online practice where our users were lacking. They were knowing the answers but they were unable to access the typical style of questions in a short time.Practice makes a man perfectYou might come across several websites or offline platforms where the information will be as per the standards. But sometimes it is not adequate to have all the knowledge. It is a matter of practice as well.We conducted testing phases where users were knowing all the basics and advanced skills relevant to their exams or assessment but they still fell short. What we accessed, despite knowing all the answers by heart. It was a typical question structuring and a short time limit which was causing issues.Where we stand tallWe dont discourage having enough knowledge about any particular field but you should be a master in picking up the right answer given through tricky structure, even within a pretty short time. Thats what online testsassessments or tricky interviews do. We are going to make you practice the questions through our most interactive practicing modes.Practice questions through real simulationSo, we are not only providing you the knowledge as per the standard criteria but we are giving you an atmosphere where you feel like taking a real exam. We have implemented MCQs and all other questions in the same typical way as they appear in real exam format. Hence, our online practice will make you sharp in guessing the right answer even within a short time. You will be able to focus on knowing the answer instead of getting confused about the ambiguous structures and this all will be possible due to our online practice sessions.We mainly provide tests and MCQs for the following categories, IT Programming Design Multimedia Writing Translation Sales Marketing Admin Support Engineering Manufacturing Finance ManagementOur interactive system will take you towards perfectionWe are not only providing you enough chance to practice questions online through practicing mode but we will be making you assess your own ability, too. Yes, if you are done with practicing all the scenarios then you can go for the trial before appearing for the real exam. Our virtual testing mode will ask random questions within a short time but answers will be shown at the end.Hence, you can really judge yourself where you stand and improve your deficiency.What's next in our minds.Based on the feedback and our previous experiences, we have been doing well when it comes to providing solutions for real exam scenarios through real exam simulations. We are in the process of gathering a huge team of professionals from every possible domain.

Across venues, and not just in Pallekele, England have increasingly leaned on their slower bowlers to control different phases of the game.The numbers underline that shift. England's spinners have picked up 19 wickets in the tournament, the third-most among all teams, and under Harry Brook the side has bowled more overs of spin than pace, with 53.2 per cent of their overs coming from slower bowlers.The captain's tactical tilt is notable. Brook is the only England skipper to use spin for more than 40 per cent of overs among those who have led in at least 10 matches, and his tenure has also produced a success rate of 75 per cent. In conditions like Pallekele, that flexibility has allowed England to operate with multiple spin options across phases rather than treating it as a middle-overs-only resource.Liam Dawson pointed to the variety within the group as a key reason behind that comfort, as well as experience.\"I think so, yeah. I think we're all very different types of spinners as well. Obviously Jacksy Will Jacks gets very good overspin, very good bounce. Obviously, Dilly Adil Rashid has all the variations and me, I sort of don't get the bounce that the other two get. So, yeah, we're very different in how we go about things,\" Dawson said ahead of England's match against Pakistan.\"I think we're all very experienced. I think if you look at the amount of cricket that me and Adil have played, even Jacks as well. It's probably only with Beth Jacob Bethell that's probably got a little bit less experience when it comes to bowling. But yeah, there's a lot of trust in the guys that go out there and try and execute what you want to try and do. Some days it works, and obviously some days it doesn't, but I think T20 cricket can be a little fickle sometimes.\"Considering the varied spin options in the England setup, the brief to the slow bowlers can also differ. For someone like Dawson, the role is often about keeping things quiet and allowing pressure to build. That said, he is also the second-highest wicket-taker among England's spinners since the 2024 T20 World Cup, with 22 wickets at an average of 20.59 and an economy of 8.06. \"We're all very different, out of the three or four of us I'm probably more the defensive spinner in this and I know that's my role and I'm just trying to be consistent for the captain. Adil can use all his tricks and he comes on us to get the wickets and get us back in games or put us ahead in games. Obviously Jacks has been brilliant, he's exploited conditions here very very well, with the overspin he gets. So we're all very different and hopefully we can continue, and obviously include Beth in that as well.\"For all the control with the ball, England know their batting against spin can still be better. Dawson, though, framed it through results first.\"Of course, we know that we can play a lot better than we've played, but at the end of the day in tournament cricket you just need to get the win. However ugly it looks,\" said Dawson. \"I think we were very good in the bilateral series here against Sri Lanka, where we played spin. We had a couple of tough games potentially, but we won. And then of the day we know that we can bat a lot better than what we batted, but we've won games and that's the main thing.\"TAGSRELATED STORIESLATEST NEWS Page 3: Live Cricket Score, Schedule, Latest News, Stats Videos Cricket TeamsLATEST NEWS Page 4: Latest and breaking Cricket News - Cricbuzz Cricbuzz.com cricket news and editorialscricket news and editorialsThe previous World Cup outing in Ahmedabad handed a winning Indian team an inexplicable final loss, the latest one has hit them with an identity crisisThe previous World Cup outing in Ahmedabad handed a winning Indian team an inexplicable final loss, the latest one has hit them with an identity crisisAs JK step into uncharted territory, Karnataka return to a stage they once owned, setting up a spicy final in HubballiAs JK step into uncharted territory, Karnataka return to a stage they once owned, setting up a spicy final in HubballiLeft-arm spinner highlights key differences within the attack, even as England pivot towards greater usage of spin under BrookLeft-arm spinner highlights key differences within the attack, even as England pivot towards greater usage of spin under BrookIndia's assistant coach opened up about the selection calls and the road ahead in the World CupIndia's assistant coach opened up about the selection calls and the road ahead in the World CupWith their opening Super Eights fixture getting washed out, Pakistan's semifinal hopes will be dented if they lose to EnglandWith their opening Super Eights fixture getting washed out, Pakistan's semifinal hopes will be dented if they lose to EnglandSee Lungi, know Lungi is one thing.

He endured it on one of the most harrowing nights in Indian cricket nearly two and a half years ago. He was at the centre of another such deflating experience on Sunday, leading the team this time. The stakes weren't as high as a World Cup final, but they had consequences that still cut deep.At the end of it, he said: \"Sometimes you've got to think, if you're chasing 180-185, you can't win the game in the Powerplay, but you might lose the game in the Powerplay.\"An inference like that was unthinkable until three weeks ago, when India strutted into the World Cup as the most feared batting unit, playing with a sense of arrogance and setting benchmarks. The defining motif of this team's success in this World Cup cycle (between 2024 and 2026) began with unyielding Powerplay intentions. They've scored at close to 10 runs an over in that phase - only England among the Super Eights teams have bettered that tally.Strike-rates across phases in this World Cup cycle (Teams in India's Super Eights Group)But this tinge of conservatism in Suryakumar's ideas is not sudden. It's been the World Cup's narrative: India's batters have been tripped up early by sticky surfaces across venues. Before the Namibia fixture in Delhi, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate reckoned India needed to consider a batting plan B after what went down against USA in Mumbai. There, India were down to 464 in the Powerplay and needed timely rescuing from their captain.The win papered over the cracks, and against Namibia they slipped back into their usual groove with 861 in six overs. Yet, Ishan Kishan, who smashed 61 off 24, pointed out that the pitch was sticky early on. Hardik Pandya, the other half-centurion from the game, went a step further, claiming that both pitches India had played on until then weren't conducive to batting and that they'd prefer flatter surfaces in the tournament.That preference does a disservice to the batting talent at India's disposal at the top and the depth until 8. But go back to the strike-rates table and you will understand why. True surfaces in all four home series during this World Cup cycle allowed them to fly at the start, force bowling teams into course-corrections and as a result, keep their foot on the throat in the other two phases. When conditions have denied them the first act of this three-act play, they've been made to look distinctly one-dimensional.Against USA in the group stage and South Africa in the Super Eights, they've had their wings clipped early. Their quality rose above the surface against the Associate side, but the 2024 finalists buried them after knocking them back in the first six overs (313). \"I've sort of banged the drum about it. I think the biggest challenge for us is finding a way to play on wickets that are not typical to what we're playing on,\" ten Doeschate said in Ahmedabad.This is another reiteration that India need to rewire some of their habits to account for pitches where the ball will hold up before reaching them, and swinging through the line will not always clear the infield. It's perhaps easier in theory to suggest a shift than to implement it for players who've built their batting approach over the last two years in a certain style in very different and docile conditions at home. They've had the confidence to go hell for leather in the first six overs, and the backing when it didn't come off. In this period, those with the gumption to be exceptional good-wicket batters have been given the keys to the top-order and made the flag-bearers of the very identity of this team.The question for India is whether recalibration is truly possible at this juncture for batters wired to hit it big from the first ball. But there is little time for such ideological debates. Now that the conditions have thrown a curveball at them and left them on thin ice with a terrible Net Run Rate (-0.388), their title defence rests on how the batters improvise over the next one week against Zimbabwe and West Indies.TAGSRELATED STORIESIndia's identity crisisThe hollow feeling of losing a big World Cup match at the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad is not new for Suryakumar Yadav.

They'd kept quiet while a nearly 10-minute conversation ensued at the press conference room in the lead up to the Ranji Trophy 2025-26 final. Right after the final question was answered, one of them sprang to task. \" Captains ka handshake karao .\"Paras Dogra and Devdutt Padikkal, two tall, lean men sitting behind a desk topped up with mics, in ear-shot of that instruction, awkwardly placed their hands just above the obstruction-set to get click ready.Dogra may have been around the circuit for nearly 25 years. He has seen the evolution of Indian domestic cricket from various extremes - playing the zonal format, at neutral venues, in the plate division, for teams featuring in their maiden season. The list is endless. Over these years, he has learned to adapt to all sorts of conditions: the green tracks, the dust bowls, the dead pitches. What he hasn't learnt though is to pose ahead of a tournament final in a press room surrounded by nearly 40 men and women holding cameras and recorders. Mid-way into his third decade as a domestic cricketer, it's still a fresh experience.As the silence stretched for a few awkward seconds, someone had to say it. This was the Ranji Trophy final - the grandest stage of India's domestic calendar - unfolding in Hubballi, a small city unaccustomed to such theatre. And yet, here were two captains, stuck in an ungainly handshake.Who would bell the cat?It had to be someone who would be answerable by evening, their name attached to this frame in the next morning's papers. The photographers. One of them took the bullet for the rest.\"Standing handshake.\"Padikkal, just as new to the experience, stood up and turned to his right, uncomfortably staring into the eyes of Dogra, unsure for how long he was to hold that pose and stare. The act of shaking hands that the two of them would've learnt in school and repeated after every cricket match they ever played, suddenly seemed liked it required training. Padikkal also muttered an awkward 'Best of luck' to keep up with the charade.In the 10 minutes preceding that pose-gymnastic, it seemed like neither of these two captains would be ever called in to cut a promo for a boxing match. The show and talk ranged from nervousness to subtle confidence. Even the odd display of chest-thumping and power-posturing that came through when Dogra sent a reminder of the team's victories in the knockouts - against Madhya Pradesh in Indore and Bengal in Kalyani - was spelt out softly, with a bit of hesitation.Could they beat Karnataka in Karnataka to win a title they have never won? Jorge Luis Borges once wrote that \"any life, no matter how long and complex it may be, is made up chiefly of a single moment.\" For JK cricket, that moment is now, and possibly for Dogra too, whose illustrious cricket career is devoid of the prized silverware.\"Obviously it's a very big moment for us,\" Dogra admitted. \"We are just trying to stay calm and composed. We will stick to our basics, let's see how it goes.\"The restraint was understandable. For a team playing its first final, up against statistically the second-most successful side in the tournament's history, the odds are firmly stacked against them. But Jammu Kashmir would know this is no accident. They have been building toward this moment for two seasons.And recent history offers them encouragement. In the past decade, whenever a legacy heavyweight has met a never-been-champions in the title clash, it is the outsider that has prevailed. Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh over Mumbai, Vidarbha over Delhi. Saurashtra over Bengal. Pedigree has not always dictated destiny.Yet, the question remains, what happened to the careers of players in those winning teams after they won the title? How many of them found a place in the national team after their team's maiden title victory?What could a Ranji Trophy win mean to the players of Jammu Kashmir?There couldn't have been more contrasting men seated next to each other to showcase the peculiar cruelty. Dogra has outlasted selectors and teammates, only to find himself one game away from a trophy that never seemed in reach even as has piled up those big runs season-after-season, as a late-bloomer, for Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and now Jammu Kashmir. He missed the bus to the national side even before he could unlock the next level of his batting.Padikkal, who took over the captaincy midway through the campaign, on the other hand has scored nearly as many runs as Dogra this season (in fewer innings). But he will be aware that he is already on fringes of the national team and a title win might just nudge the selectors into considering him once more. The hope for such optimism features all around him - KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Karun Nair and Prasidh Krishna. Dogra has barely witnessed that across teams, across decades.Can an Auqib Nabi, with 55 wickets already this season, aspire with the same confidence to play for India later this year? Or is the card of success for one only a card of hope for another? Has the climb to this moment already come to matter more than the summit still unseen? The limelight may not have been on Dogra for those few minutes in the press conference room, with questions largely fielded by home-boy Padikkal, who is tasked with bringing the cup back for the ninth time. That's not to say where the limelight of the contest, outside the room, really is. Jammu Kashmir have entered their maiden final, and the magnanimity of the moment isn't lost on anyone. Former cricketers, politicians - including the chief minister - have all joined the discussion and celebrations.Some have joined to even take potshots at the opposition. Samiullah Beigh, the former JK pacer, wrote on Twitter, \"A quick glance at the journey of two Ranji Trophy 2026 finalists reveals that it is going to be a direct contest between Karnataka's batting vs JK's bowling. Going by the defensive mindset shown by Karnataka in the Semis , I am certain thatL0KSCA would do everything in their control to provide the flattest deck possible to negate JK bowlers and then bank on its batting prowess to win the match on first innings-lead basis.\"Beige's assessment could come true, not necessarily due to KSCA's 'smart gamesmanship', but because Karnataka have mustered 500-plus inning totals in each of their last three games at the venue. But Beigh believes such a ploy might have its cons, drawing parallels with India's loss in the 2023 World Cup final.The passion is understandable from someone who spent decades preparing for a Ranji season in trying conditions, the JK jersey on his back, sometimes with nothing more than a tennis ball bowled inside his house compound for practice.This aggressive involvement is far from the silence that Karnataka's state and cricketing establishment have paraded. Reaching the final may not be a point of success for the eight-time champions, but it's a stage they have long waited to return to - more than a decade since they won back-to-back titles, of which several players from the current lot were a part, with their status as the second-most dominant team in the country somewhat on the wane.That moment to regain lost pride has finally arrived. The venue, the conditions, the opposition and the history - all scales tilt in their favour. One team is playing to make history; the other is playing to uphold its stature. It is not always clear which is the heavier burden to carry to a final. But one thing is certain, whoever lifts the trophy by the end of this week, would surely pull out a more confident pose for the cameras.TAGSRELATED STORIESHistory vs stature - A clash of unequal burdens in the Ranji Trophy finalThe photographers had received their memo.

Which is obvious, whether we say it or not,\" the batting coach revealed after India's 76-run defeat against South Africa at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. \"We thought that an off-spinner was needed because three left-handers upfront. We got the wickets in the beginning. Washington didn't bowl in the Powerplay.\"But, actually, he was supposed to bowl in a Powerplay. So, that can change according to the match. For that reason, this combination was decided. And the rest - what you are saying about confidence - Axar is such a player; he has played so much and performed so much, he doesn't lack confidence. It was very clear from him, and from the head coach and the captain, what we are thinking and why we are doing this.\"Kotak also admitted the team is in a situation where it may have to rethink on the opening combination and Sanju Samson may come into the equation. \"See, basically, if we felt that Sanju's last few innings were low on confidence and Ishan was scoring runs, then obviously you go with Ishan.\"Now we are in a situation where we have to think about whether we need to change anything or if we should still go with the same thing. But yes, it is definitely something to think about. If we have to change something, what do we change and how do we change it?\"Having lost one Super Eight game, India are in a pressure situation with a need to win the remaining two fixtures. But Kotak says the players are used to such situations.\"See, I feel that even in a normal game, if you play in India, there is natural pressure. Any professional - any batsman or bowler - feels it when they are playing. There is more pressure on the batsman because it is a one-ball game. For a bowler, it is different. If he misses one or two balls, he can still bowl a good one.But with the amount of cricket we play, we have to take that pressure. Everyone has to take it - that anxiety, that pressure. If a batsman does not take it at this level, or if a bowler does not take it, then where will he take it? \"So there will be pressure. That is the whole thing. But there are two matches left. We know where we are. One bad day we had - we have to accept it - we did not play well. And we will have to move forward and try to win the two games properly because we do not have any other option, whether we take pressure or not.\"TAGSRELATED STORIESLATEST NEWS Page 8: Spin in focus again as high-flying England eye Pakistan scalp Cricbuzz.com Spin in focus again as high-flying England eye Pakistan scalpEngland gear up for their second game in Pallekele with early control of Group 2 in the Super Eights after their commanding win over Sri Lanka. Pakistan, meanwhile, have a solitary point following the washout against New Zealand and will be searching for more to boost their chances of a semifinal push. The table, though still young, already places a bit of an urgency on Pakistan, who cannot afford to drift. England, by contrast, have momentum but not necessarily complete clarity in all departments.History has largely favoured England. They lead the overall T20I head-to-head 21-9 and have won all three previous meetings against Pakistan in T20 World Cups, including the 2022 final. In Pallekele, where surfaces have consistently brought spin into the contest, adaptability will again be tested. England hold a slight advantage in that regard, having already played the bilateral series here against Sri Lanka as well as their first Super 8 fixture, while this will be Pakistan's first outing at the venue in the competition.If there is one area England will want sharper returns from, it is the top order. Despite Phil Salt's fine knock of 62 against Sri Lanka, England's openers have produced the lowest aggregate amongst all teams in the Super Eights. They have just one 50-plus stand in ten innings and have failed to bat beyond the fourth over together in any game. That fragility at the top becomes particularly relevant against a Pakistan attack that has traditionally thrived when early pressure is created. Will Jacks has come to the rescue plenty of times for England in this World Cup, but the 2022 champions would prefer a firmer cushion from their top order.The broader concern for England is their record against spin in this edition. They have already lost 21 wickets to spin, the most by any side in the tournament, with their average against slower bowlers sitting below 23. With both teams having relied heavily on spin at different stages of the innings, Tuesday's contest could well hinge on which batting unit negotiates spin with greater control.Pakistan, meanwhile, have their own points of focus. Sahibzada Farhan's prolific run in T20 cricket since the start of 2025, including five hundreds in that period, offers them a game-changer at the top. However, while Farhan's form is a major positive, the rest of Pakistan's batting order is yet to make a significant mark. All average below 30 in this tournament and none has registered a fifty-plus score, placing added pressure on Farhan to provide strong starts. Against an England attack that did well to defend 146 against Sri Lanka, Pakistan's batters could have their work cut out.When: Tuesday, February 24 at 7:00 PM Local TimeWhere: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele What to expect: Having been under covers for long periods, the surface showed some stickiness in the previous Super Eights game here, making run-scoring far from straightforward. However, with no rain around now, the pitch has had time to settle, which could aid better batting compared to the England-Sri Lanka game. That said, spin is still expected to play a major role. On the weather front, there is no rain forecast for Tuesday.England: Harry Brook's side has remained unchanged for a while and are likely to stick with the same combination. Meanwhile, it is still unclear whether Jacob Bethell will be able to bowl after injuring his finger earlier in the competition.Probable XI : Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook (c), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Liam Dawson, Jofra Archer, Adil RashidPakistan: Even though Shaheen Afridi spent a fair amount of time bowling in the practice session on the eve of the game, it appears unlikely that the left-armer will return to the XI, with Salman Mirza set to retain his place. Pakistan brought back Fakhar Zaman into the mix against New Zealand in place of Khawaja Nafay. With the game getting washed out, they would want to stick to their call and give the experienced Zaman a go.Meanwhile, it will be interesting to see where Babar Azam bats for Pakistan. Against Namibia, he did not come out to bat, with Khawaja Nafay and Shadab Khan sent ahead of him. \"We got to the 12th over mark and at that point, Babar Azam is not the best person to come in,\" said head coach Mike Hesson. He added: \"I think he's well aware his strike rate in the Powerplay in World Cups is less than 100 in T20s. So clearly, that's not a role that we think we need here.\"In that scenario, Babar's role could be limited to that of a stabiliser at No. 4 in case of early wickets.Probable XI : Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Agha (c), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan (wk), Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Salman Mirza, Usman Tariq- Under Harry Brook, England have bowled more overs of spin (53.2) than pace (46.7). He's the only English captain to use more than 40 percent of spin overs among those who have led in at least 10 games. Brook also has a success percentage of 75 which is the highest for all England captains.- England's pacers have picked up 11 wickets in the Powerplay, second most after South Africa in this World Cup. Jofra Archer has picked up seven of them - the joint most in the tournament in this phase alongside Shadley van Schalkwyk.- Sahibzada Farhan is the leading run-getter in T20s since January 2025, with 2295 runs in 62 innings at an average of 39.56 and a strike rate of 150. He has also scored five hundreds in this period - the most by any batter. \"Obviously they're a very good team with some dangerous players and Tariq's obviously a very good bowler. I'm sure the boys will do their homework... You know, it's not all about Tariq. I think they've got a very well-rounded team as well. So we're not going to just look at him, we'll look at the whole team and see how we can nullify them\" - Liam Dawson .\"No, it's not a big deal to face Jofra Archer. We have already faced him in Pakistan. We have good bowlers, they also bowl at 145. So it's not a big deal. They (England) will definitely have planned it, but I have also planned it. It's not that only he will have plans. So, we will see. It will be a good match\" - Sahibzada Farhan .TAGSRELATED STORIESLATEST NEWS Page 9: Under the radar but inescapable: Ngidi's smoke and mirrors night Cricbuzz.com Under the radar but inescapable: Ngidi's smoke and mirrors nightIt's difficult to hide Lungi Ngidi. He's 1.93 metres tall, he seems almost as broad as that at the shoulders, and he has perhaps the most dazzling smile in all of cricket. See Lungi, know Lungi.But there Ngidi was at the Narendra Modi Stadium after South Africa's 76-run triumph over India in their T20 World Cup Super Eights match on Sunday, hiding in plain sight. And plainly enjoying his apparent invisibility.He was on his way to the mixed zone - a more informal interaction with reporters than a press conference - when he found his path blocked by two men. They hadn't seen Ngidi coming, and he didn't alert them to his presence. Instead he stood close to them and smiled that dazzling smile, waiting for them to turn their heads and see him. Clearly, he had pulled this party trick before.After several seconds, one head turned. Then the other. Then both heads tilted up and up and up, until their faces met the smile and the just as dazzling eyes. See Lungi, know Lungi.Ngidi would have been able to walk around the two men easily enough. But he chose to loom near them, pausing for the moment they realised a man as formidable as he is famous was looming over them.When they did, they gave way like the velvet curtains on a Broadway stage. The show had to go on, and Ngidi took it with him as he went; maybe a little taller and broader, and the wattage of his smile hiked to nuclear levels. As slices of life go, it was delicious.See Lungi, know Lungi is one thing. See Lungi, hit Lungi is quite another. The Indians found that out to their cost on Sunday. He bowled to Suryakumar Yadav, Abhishek Sharma, Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Varun Chakravarthy. The latter aside, those are among the most destructive hitters in the global game, bristling with strike rates that range from Abhishek's 191.25 to Hardik's 144.48. Abhishek is No. 1 in the batting rankings in the format with Suryakumar at No. 6.And yet they couldn't lay a bat on Ngidi's deliveries solidly enough to score more than 15 runs off his bowling. That's an economy rate of 3.75 - identical to Jasprit Bumrah's on the night. But Bumrah took three wickets. For the first time in the tournament, Ngidi took none. That didn't stop the press from requesting his presence at the mixed zone.Because while Marco Jansen and Keshav Maharaj grabbed the glory with their hauls of 422 and 324, they wouldn't have been able to do that without Ngidi's ability to be seen but not hit.\"I looked at the scoreboard and saw India's position, and I knew what I had to do,\" Ngidi said. \"It was more about building pressure than trying to be greedy and put my name up in the wickets column.\" Ngidi is well capable of cranking up the pace above 140 kilometres an hour. So it is a credit to his cleverness, creativity and cunning that he has developed what seems to be an array of different slower balls. If the speed doesn't get you, the sneakiness does. Often, one of those attributes sets up the other for the kill. It's beautiful to watch, not to face.How many different slower balls has he mastered to be a sustained threat at the highest level of the most unforgiving format for bowlers?\"Probably only two,\" Ngidi said. \"It's just a difference of length.\" Only two?! What are they called? Smoke and mirrors?But wait. There's more: \"Tonight I used my leg-cutter because I knew they were preparing for just an off-cutter. I could see Surya set up, looking to lift it over the leg side. It was about showing him something different to keep him guessing.\"He learnt the slower ball from Dwayne Bravo while riding the bench for Chennai Super Kings in 2018 - Ngidi played only seven of the franchise's 16 matches that year. He left the country as a booming fast bowler, and returned with skills that will serve him well as he contemplates turning 30 next month.\"I wasn't playing much, so I got time to practise it,\" Ngidi said. \"And when I got back to South Africa, I just tried to perfect that ball. It took a while, but over the years I've realised that using different lengths is what's actually the best. Whether it's a slower ball yorker, or on a length, or a slower ball bouncer. It's three different lengths with the same ball. You've got to guess which one's coming next.\"My slower ball gives me the upper hand because batters can't just swing at every ball. I think that's where I come into the game. Once you start second-guessing your options as a batter, that's what a bowler really wants.\"Bumrah is a past master at doing exactly that. Consequently the cricketminded world seems to stop whatever it's doing to watch India's finest bowl. How will he fool them this time, what magic is coming, where's that intelligence going to go now, they ask themselves. With Ngidi? Not so much.\"I fly under the radar, so not many people pay attention to me,\" Ngidi said. \"I guess that helps me in terms of being able to use all these variations. All of a sudden, once the pressure's building, I don't think batters have an answer for what I'm about to deliver next.

The N score is out of 24 and measures how neurotic you are.To interpret the scores, your E score and your N score are plotted on a graph from which you can read your personality characteristics. The nearer the outside of the circle you are, the more marked are the personality traits. Please note that the EPI is a very simplistic type of personality measurement scale, so if you have come out as a personality that does not match what you thought before you took the test, you are probably right and the test is probably wrong!InstructionsHere are some questions regarding the way you behave, feel and act. Each question has radio buttons to answer YES or NO. Try to decide whether YES or NO represents your usual way of acting or feeling. Then check those radio named YES or NO.

Around 1000 posts get submitted each day, but most importantly, HN readers are known for valuing content quality a lot.Knowing all this, and for the sake of experiment, I wondered if some titles performed better than others and decided to see what would the best HN post title, statistically speaking, look like.To write this post, I analyzed all (2,6 millions) HN submissions titles since 2006 and up until the end of 2019 coming from this dataset .This is what I found.General findingsNumber of submissionsAccording to Similar Web HN has more than 10 millions visitors per month.Here is the number of posts per quarter since the launch of the website, as you can see, this number has been pretty stable for the last 6 years.Points per submissionsAs said earlier, it is hard to have your post liked by the community. By default, all posts have 1 point.Some users have the ability to downvote posts and so some posts have a score of 0.Below is the distribution of posts score.As you can see, almost 66 of all posts don't manage to have more than 2 points, which mean that 66 of all posts are not even upvoted by another person as every posts begin with a score of 1.Title length distributionI also wanted to know the title length distribution of posts.The distribution is almost perfectly centered on seven. It is actually not a surprise to have a number that low, post title in HN can't exceed 80 characters.Knowing all this, let's now move to the most interesting part.The quest to the perfect titleThe importance of title lengthI decided to plot the median score per number of words in post title.Unsurprisingly, no matter your title length, your median score will be 2 or 3. The fact that more than 66 of every posts never reach more than 2 points explains it.But if we choose to discard posts that don't perform, let's say post with less than 5 points, the chart is not really the same.A good way to phrase this finding:No matter your title length, your post won't perform well, but in the case it does, you'd want your title to be as short as possibleI was curious about those \"1 word title\" submissions that performs so well, here are some fun ones: 2048: release of the famous game, 2903 points Hyperloop Atom: Atom announcementBest categoriesSome submission on Hacker News relate to precise topics and follow a strict title format.They can be split into 5 categories:It is worth noting that a post can overlap multiple categories. For example a post whose title is \" Scale (YC S16) is hiring engineers to build infrastructure for AI\", is counted as a \"YC\" post and an \"is hiring\" post.Posts related to YC companies seem to perform better than the others. However, if we only take into account posts with more thant 5 upvotes, those who talk about companies currently hiring are the champions.Top performing wordsNow let's find if some words, when they appeared in title, are correlated to posts performing better.For every posts in the dataset, I've split its title in single words, removing stop words (a, the, an, etc..).I ended up with a big array which size is the number of words per titles times the number of posts , where each line was a word of one post's title associated with the score of said post.Finally I aggregated everything, and was able to find the top 50 words that had the best score.I must admit it took quite a bit of time and almost killed my 2013 MacBook pro. Below is the scatter plot of my findings.The word \"zwiebelfreunde\" appeared in 7 submissions titles, and the median score of all those submission was 121 points. Impressive.As you can see, some words really stand out. \"ProfitMonth\" is here because of thosepoststalking about the history of FipLab. \"Mathics\" is an open source alternative to Mathematica \"Jmap\" is an open API standard for modern mail clientsConclusionSo here is what we know can make a post successful on HN: a short title talking about a YC startup talking about hiring JMAP or LinuxInsides in the titleHence our result for the best HN post title possible: \"JMAP\" .Ok this was a bit of a let down, let's try something else: \"JMAP (YC S10) Linux Inside is hiring\" and see how it goes .BonusWhile writing this blog post I've made other fun discoveries.Those were not big enough to deserve their own article but were interesting nonetheless.Most common programming languageHere are the 25 programming language appearing the most time in HN post titles.C is not here as it was considered a stop-word.HN trendI've also analysed the evolution of number of occurrence of particular words in post titles over time.Before you go, check out these related reads: Are Product Hunt's featured products still online today?

Page 7: 10 Tips on How to make Python's Beautiful Soup faster when scraping 10 Tips on How to make Python's Beautiful Soup faster when scrapingBeautiful Soup is super easy to use for parsing HTML and is hugely popular. However, if you're extracting a gigantic amount of data from tons of scraped pages it can slow to a crawl if not properly optimized.In this tutorial, I'll show you 10 expert-level tips and tricks for transforming Beautiful Soup into a blazing-fast data-extracting beast and how to optimize your scraping process to be as fast as lightning.Factors affecting the speed of Beautiful SoupBeautiful Soup's performance can vary based on several factors. Here are some key factors that influence the speed of web scraping using Beautiful Soup . Parser Choice:The parser you choose (such aslxml,html.parser, orhtml5lib) significantly impacts Beautiful Soup's speed and performance. Document Complexity:Parsing large or complex HTMLXML documents can be resource-intensive, which ultimately results in slower execution times. CSS Selectors:Using complex or inefficient CSS selectors can slow down the parsing process. Connection Overhead:Repeatedly establishing new connections for each request can significantly reduce the speed. So, using sessions or persistent connections can help a lot. Concurrency:Using multi-threading or asynchronous processing allows you for concurrent fetching and parsing, which improve the overall speed.Many other factors affect Beautiful Soup's performance, which we'll explore further in the following sections, along with strategies to make beautiful soup faster.How to profile the different performance factorsProfiling is an important step in identifying performance bottlenecks in any software application. Python provides several tools for profiling, with cProfile being one of the most commonly used for identifying slow parts of the code. By analyzing the output of a profiler, developers can pinpoint areas that require optimization and implement alternative approaches to make beautiful soup faster.cProfile is a built-in Python module that allows you to profile the execution time of various parts of a program.Here's a quick example of how to profile a code:So, were using cProfile.run() for a quick overview of the performance.If you want more detailed and sorted profiling results, you can add the following code to sort and format the output:Here, were pstats.Stats with sorting options like cumulative to get more detailed and sorted output.By using tools like cProfile to identify bottlenecks and employing strategies such as choosing the right parser, optimizing CSS selectors, leveraging concurrency, and implementing caching, developers can significantly improve the efficiency of their web scraping projects.Tip 1: Effective use of parsers in beautiful soupOne of the main factors that impact the performance of Beautiful Soup is the choice of parser. A common mistake many developers make is selecting any parser without considering its effect on speed and efficiency. Beautiful Soup supports multiple parsers, including html.parser , lxml , and html5lib , each with its unique features and performance characteristics. Choosing the right parser can significantly make beautiful soup faster. But how do you select the best parser for your specific needs? Let's look at the several options to help you make the correct decision.html5libhtml5lib is a parser that's great for handling messy HTML because it parses documents the same way a web browser would. It's especially useful when dealing with poorly structured HTML or pages that use newer HTML5 elements. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of slower performance compared to other parsers.The results for the html5lib parser show that it made 318,133 function calls in 1.030 seconds.html.parserhtml.parser is the default parser that comes with Python's standard library, and it offers better performance than html5lib . It's a good choice for smaller projects or when dealing with HTML that is relatively well-structured.The results for html.parser shows that it made 170272 function calls in 22.626 seconds. This is significantly faster than html5lib .lxmlThe lxml parser is the fastest option among the parsers supported by Beautiful Soup. It's built on the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt , which offer great performance and support for advanced features like XPath and XSLT.The lxml parser shows great performance, making 141250 function calls in just 22.625 seconds. This was the fastest result among the parsers tested.Performance analysisWe measured the time each parser took to process the same HTML document. html5lib: This parser is the slowest, as it takes the most time to process the document. This is due to its comprehensive approach to handling malformed HTML. html.parser: It is faster thanhtml5lib, but it still falls short oflxmlin terms of speed. It provides a good balance between speed and robustness for moderately well-formed HTML. lxml: The lxml parser is the fastest and most efficient for parsing well-formed HTML and XML documents.Tip 2: Reducing network load with sessionsAnother common mistake developers make is establishing a new connection for each request, which can significantly slow down the process. To avoid this, you can use sessions to maintain persistent connections, reducing connection overhead. The Python requests library provides a Session object that can be reused for multiple requests to the same server.For example, using a session can be as simple as:Maintaining a session helps you avoid the time-consuming process of setting up a new connection for each request. This is especially useful when scraping multiple pages from the same domain, as it allows faster and more efficient data extraction.Tip 3: Using multi-threading and asynchronous processingMulti-threading and asynchronous processing are techniques that can significantly improve the performance of web scraping tasks by enabling concurrent execution of tasks.Using multi-threadingThe ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module is a popular tool for implementing multi-threading in Python. It enables you to create a pool of threads and manage their execution efficiently.Heres how to use ThreadPoolExecutor with Beautiful Soup:This approach results in 1,357,674 function calls completed in 23.274 seconds. The code creates a pool of five threads, with each thread responsible for fetching and parsing a URL. The ascompleted function is then used to iterate over the completed futures, allowing you to process results as soon as it is ready.Using asynchronous processingFor asynchronous processing, the combination of the asyncio library with aiohttp provides a powerful solution for managing web requests. aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client that integrates smoothly with asyncio , allowing you to perform web scraping without blocking other operations.You can also check out a detailed guide on how to use asyncio for web scraping with Python .Heres an example of how you can use these libraries to implement asynchronous web scraping:This asynchronous approach results in 126,515 function calls completed in 22.383 seconds.In this example, aiohttp.ClientSession is used to manage HTTP connections, and asyncio.gather is used to run multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently. This approach allows you to handle a large number of requests efficiently, as the event loop manages the execution of tasks without blocking.Combining multi-threading and asynchronous processingMulti-threading and asynchronous processing are effective individually as we can see, however, combining them can lead to even better performance gains. For example, you can use asynchronous processing to handle network requests and multi-threading to parse HTML content simultaneously, optimizing both fetching and processing times.Heres a code of this combined approach:This combined approach yields 125,608 function calls completed in just 1.642 seconds.In this hybrid approach, aiohttp and asyncio are used to fetch web pages asynchronously, while ThreadPoolExecutor handles the HTML parsing concurrently. By combining these methods, you can use the strengths of both asynchronous processing and multi-threading to achieve maximum performance in your web scraping tasks.Observation? The combined approach delivered the best performance, with an execution time of just 1.642 seconds, compared to 23.274 seconds for multi-threading alone and 22.383 seconds for pure asynchronous processing.Tip 4: Caching techniques to speed up scrapingCaching is an excellent method to improve the performance of your web scraping activities. By temporarily storing data, caching decreases the frequency of repeated requests to the server. Therefore, when you make the same request again, it retrieves the data from the local cache rather than fetching it from the server, ultimately reducing the load on external resources.One of the easiest ways to add caching to your web scraping is by using the requests-cache , a persistent cache for Python requests.First, install the requests-cache library using pip:You can then use requestscache.CachedSession to make your requests. This session behaves like a standard requests.Session , but includes caching functionality.Here's a simple code:When you run the script for the first time, data is fetched from the server, as shown below:In this initial request, the operation involves approximately 602,701 function calls and takes about 2.939 seconds.Now, when you run the same script again, the data is retrieved from the cache: Here, the cached response makes about 602,477 function calls and completes in 1.333 seconds. This shows an improvement in speed and efficiency due to caching.Customizing cacherequests-cache allows you to customize cache behaviour according to your needs. For example, you can choose different backends (e.g., SQLite, Redis), set expiration times, and specify which HTTP methods to cache.You might also want to cache only specific types of responses, such as successful ones. This can be achieved using the cachefilter parameter, which allows you to define a custom filtering function:Tip 5: UsingSoupStrainerfor partial parsingWhen working with large documents, sometimes you might prefer to parse just a portion rather than the entire content. Beautiful Soup makes this easier with SoupStrainer , which lets you filter out the unnecessary parts and focus only on what matters.So, by parsing only the parts of the document you need, you can significantly reduce the time and resources required for parsing.Tip 6: Optimizing CSS selectorsWhen using Beautiful Soup to extract specific elements from HTML, the efficiency of your CSS selectors plays a crucial role in performance. By narrowing the scope of your selectors, you can significantly reduce parsing time. Instead of using broad selectors that traverse a large portion of the DOM tree, focus on targeting elements directly. You can also refer to a detailed guide on using CSS selectors for web scraping .Tip 7: Using proxy servers for load balancingProxy servers act as intermediaries between your scraper and the target website. They distribute requests across multiple IP addresses, which helps reduce the risk of being blocked and balances the load of requests. This is particularly useful for scraping websites with rate limits or IP-based restrictions. You can also check out the detailed guide on getting started with BeautifulSoup .To use proxies with Beautiful Soup, you can configure the requests library to route requests through a proxy server.In the code, requests are routed through the proxy server specified in the proxies dictionary. This helps in balancing the request load and improving the performance of Beautiful Soup.Tip 8: Managing rate limits with sessions and proxiesWhen web scraping, it's important to respect the rate limits set by the target server to avoid getting blocked. You can effectively manage the frequency of your requests by using sessions and proxies. Additionally, introducing a delay between requests can also help.In the code, using requests.Session can speed up web scraping by reusing connections. Setting up proxies to rotate IP addresses helps distribute the load and avoid rate limits. Additionally, using time.sleep() introduces pauses between requests, which helps you stay within server limits and reduces the risk of getting blocked.Tip 9: Error handling and retry logic with proxies When scraping the web, using proxies is great, but you also have to manage connection errors and timeouts. Therefore, it's important to use error handling and retry logic to ensure effective web scraping. For example, if a request fails, attempting a retry with a different proxy can significantly improve the likelihood of success.Heres the code of how to implement retry logic with proxies.This code tries to fetch data from a URL using different proxy servers. It retries the request up to three times if it fails, picking a new proxy for each attempt. If successful, it parses the HTML content with BeautifulSoup. If not, it continues trying with different proxies until it either succeeds or exhausts all attempts.Tip 10: Efficient data extraction with XPathAlthough Beautiful Soup is great for parsing HTML and navigating the document tree, XPath expressions can provide greater precision and flexibility when it comes to complex data extraction. The lxml library is particularly powerful because it combines the ease of HTML parsing with the advanced querying capabilities of XPath and XSLT.Before you can start using lxml , you'll need to install it:Here's a quick example of how you can use lxml with XPath:The result shows that we successfully extracted all the news titles from the URL in just 1.2 seconds which is quick and efficient.XPath expressions can be more efficient and concise than traditional CSS selectors, especially when dealing with complex document structures. This method can significantly speed up the data extraction process.Tips for efficient HTML parsingHere are some tips on how to parse HTML more efficiently.1. Navigating the DOM tree: Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM) is crucial for efficient HTML parsing. The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects.2. Traversing the DOM: Use.parentto access the parent of the tag and.childrento iterate over a children of the tag. This hierarchical navigation is useful for extracting nested data. Use.nextsiblingand.previoussiblingto move horizontally across the DOM tree. This is useful for extracting data from elements that are on the same level.3. Searching the DOM Tree:Efficient searching within the DOM tree is vital for extracting specific data points. BeautifulSoup offers several methods to facilitate this: Use methods such asfind()andfindall()to locate elements by tag name or attributes. Theselect()method allows for more complex queries using CSS selectors.4. Handling large documents:For large HTML documents, performance can be a concern. So, you can follow these quick tips: Consider using thelxmlParser, which is faster and more efficient for parsing large documents, as discussed earlier in detail. Installcchardetas this library speeds up encoding detection, which can be a bottleneck when parsing large files. You can also useSoupStrainerto limit parsing to only the necessary parts of the document, as discussed earlier in detail. 5. Modifying the parse tree: BeautifulSoup allows you the modification of the parse tree, like the addition, deletion, or alteration of HTML elements. This is particularly useful for cleaning up scraped data or preparing it for further analysis.6. Error handling and logging: It's important to implement error handling in your code. BeautifulSoup can encounter a lot of issues with malformed HTML or missing tags, which leads to exceptions. Therefore, using try-except blocks and logging errors can help in debugging and improving the stability of your scraper.7. Integrating with other tools: For JavaScript-heavy sites, integrating BeautifulSoup with tools like Selenium , Playwright , or Puppeteer can be very effective. BeautifulSoup can handle static HTML well, but these tools can interact with the browser to scrape dynamic content that JavaScript generates.Use a Scraping API insteadData extraction is not easy nowadays, as it involves many challenges due to the anti-bot measures put in place. Bypassing anti-bot mechanisms can be challenging and take up a lot of time and resources. Thats where web scraping APIs like ScrapingBee come in!ScrapingBee simplifies the scraping process by handling the hard parts like rotating proxies and rendering JavaScript, so you dont have to worry about getting blocked.

Decodos X-Browser (formerly Smartproxy)Decodos X-Browser is a free, lightweight anti-detect browser bundled with Decodo (formerly Smartproxy) proxies. It is suitable for simple multi-account browsing and proxy management, but too limited for serious, large-scale anti-detect work. Performance:Smooth and light for a handful of profiles, but not designed for running lots of sessions or very heavy, always-on operations. Fingerprint quality:Basic fingerprint isolation with only a few tweakable parameters, acceptable for avoiding simple tracking, but weaker than dedicated high-end anti-detect browsers. Stability:Generally stable in day-to-day use, although development is minimal and official support is already scheduled to end in 2026, which makes its long-term future uncertain. Integration capabilities:Integrates well with Decodos proxy stack, making one-click proxy setup easy, but lacks rich team features, cloud profile sync, and deep third-party ecosystem hooks. Automation support:Focused on manual use with almost no native automation or API tooling, so serious scripted workflows usually go directly through Decodo proxies in other browsers or tools instead. Pricing:Effectively free as an add-on to paid Decodo proxy plans, so you only pay for proxy traffic rather than for the browser itself. User feedback:Commonly described as a nice free bonus that is simple and beginner-friendly, but reviewers often recommend switching to a more advanced anti-detect browser once you need strong fingerprints, teams, or automation.Performance: Smooth and light for a handful of profiles, but not designed for running lots of sessions or very heavy, always-on operations.Fingerprint quality: Basic fingerprint isolation with only a few tweakable parameters, acceptable for avoiding simple tracking, but weaker than dedicated high-end anti-detect browsers.Stability: Generally stable in day-to-day use, although development is minimal and official support is already scheduled to end in 2026, which makes its long-term future uncertain.Integration capabilities: Integrates well with Decodos proxy stack, making one-click proxy setup easy, but lacks rich team features, cloud profile sync, and deep third-party ecosystem hooks.Automation support: Focused on manual use with almost no native automation or API tooling, so serious scripted workflows usually go directly through Decodo proxies in other browsers or tools instead.Pricing: Effectively free as an add-on to paid Decodo proxy plans, so you only pay for proxy traffic rather than for the browser itself.

Think of your browser fingerprint as a digital ID card that websites use to recognize you. It includes details like your browser version, operating system, screen size, installed plugins, and more. Antidetect browsers work by creating a new, unique ID for each profile, effectively wearing a disguise online. They spoof or fake these details to appear as different users, preventing websites from linking multiple accounts to the same person.This process involves sophisticated spoofing techniques, such as manipulating JavaScript APIs, WebGL settings, and HTTP headers. By isolating browser profiles in separate containers, antidetect browsers ensure that cookies and local storage dont leak between profiles, further reducing detection risk.Why Do You Need Antidetect Browsers?Antidetect browsers are essential for anyone managing multiple online identities or accounts. Common use cases include: Growth marketing and affiliate campaigns require multiple accounts. Managing e-commerce store accounts across different marketplaces. Data collection and web scraping, where IP and fingerprint rotation help avoid bans. Privacy-conscious users who want to minimize tracking. Posting on classified ads or social media platforms without risking account suspension.Growth marketing and affiliate campaigns require multiple accounts.Managing e-commerce store accounts across different marketplaces.Data collection and web scraping, where IP and fingerprint rotation help avoid bans.Privacy-conscious users who want to minimize tracking.Posting on classified ads or social media platforms without risking account suspension.Antidetect browsers provide a safer, more reliable way to automate and scale these activities.Antidetect vs Headless BrowsersWhile both anti-detect and headless browsers are used for automation, they serve different purposes. Headless browsers run without a graphical interface and are optimized for speed and resource efficiency, often used in web scraping and automated testing.However, they typically dont spoof browser fingerprints in detail, making them easier to detect by sophisticated anti-bot systems.Antidetect browsers, on the other hand, focus on fingerprint complexity and evasion. They mimic real user environments, reducing the risk of detection, but usually require more system resources. For a deeper dive into headless browsers and their use cases, check out Chrome headless browsers .When to Use Solutions Like ScrapingBeeWhile it is not exactly an anti-detect browser, ScrapingBee is ideal for full browser fingerprint spoofing when scraping.If your use case doesnt require managing multiple browser profiles or evading fingerprint detection, ScrapingBee's Web scraping API provides a simpler, scalable solution for scraping data and bypassing anti-bot measures.The platform handles proxy rotation, JavaScript rendering, and CAPTCHA solving, making it a great option for users focused on data extraction rather than multi-account management.Food for ThoughtWhile anti-detect browsers offer powerful capabilities, its crucial to use them responsibly. There are legal and ethical considerations around multi-accounting and data scraping, especially when violating terms of service or engaging in deceptive practices. Detection systems are constantly evolving, so no tool guarantees 100 invisibility. Always consider the risks, stay informed about the laws in your jurisdiction, and use anti-detect browsers in ways that respect platform policies and user privacy. Reliability can vary between tools, so thorough testing and cautious deployment are advised.Ready to Try ScrapingBee Today?If youre looking for a powerful yet simpler alternative for data gathering, web scraping, and automation tasks, especially when full fingerprint spoofing isnt necessary, ScrapingBee is here to help.

However, their legality depends on how you use them. Using them to violate terms of service, commit fraud, or engage in illegal activities is unlawful. Always use these tools responsibly.Do anti-detect browsers need a proxy?Yes, proxies are typically used alongside anti-detect browsers to mask your IP address and further reduce detection risks. Many anti-detect browsers integrate proxy management directly.What is the best free anti-detect browser?Most high-quality anti-detect browsers are paid due to the complexity involved. Some offer free trials or limited versions, but free options generally lack advanced features and reliability.Which anti-detect browser works best for SEO tasks?Browsers like Multilogin and GoLogin are popular for SEO and SERP analysis workflows due to their stability and automation support.Which anti-detect browsers work best for posting on classified ads sites?AdsPower and Dolphin Anty are favored for classified ads and social media posting thanks to their multi-account management features.What are the best anti-detect browsers for Windows users?Most anti-detect browsers support Windows, but GeeLark, Multilogin, and GoLogin are particularly well-optimized for Windows environments.Which anti-detect browsers are best for SEO and SERP analysis workflows?Multilogin, GoLogin, and GeeLark stand out for SEO professionals needing reliable fingerprint spoofing and automation.What are the best anti-detect browsers for Amazon sellers and marketplace operations?Kameleo and Multilogin are often recommended for Amazon sellers due to their mobile profile support and enterprise-grade reliability.Kevin worked in the web scraping industry for 10 years before co-founding ScrapingBee .

Fresh price data will be delivered to you every morning, more punctual than the employees in your office.Well, it is not a once-for-all work. You may spend some time maintaining the scraper now and then, but it saves you a grand number compared to the cost of data delivery for 365 sets of price data a year.Compatibility and flexibilityThe flexibility of web scraping enables you to get data exactly in the form you need it. For example, a regular expression is one of the ways to get your data cleaned. You can set commands with regex to refine the strings of data by adding a prefix, replacing A with B, cutting certain bytes of data, etc.You can use Regex to remove the string (415) from every number in your spreadsheet if you are scraping San Francisco local business numbers for your telemarketing system. Data can be cleaned as the scraper processes.File formats also make things easier. Octoparse scrapes web data into EXCEL, CSV, HTML, and JSON formats. These files are compatible with most apps and systems of data management, data analysis, and visualization.An Octoparse user once told us that he is running a price comparison website. He set the tasks to run daily so that the prices were fresh. The data scraped is automatically exported to his database which connects to his website.A web scraper can be a data pipeline that extracts data from the web, cleans it, organizes it into the right format, and copies it to your database which could be then uploaded to your websites and systems. You cant imagine how an individual could run and maintain a website by himself, getting the data on it refreshed every day without web scraping. Capacity to get data that API cantAPI is short for Application Programming Interface. An API gives people access to the data of an application or system that is granted by the owner.Understanding when to use web scraping versus APIs is crucial for effective data collection. APIs provide optimized data delivery with minimal overhead, making them significantly faster for most use cases , but they come with significant limitations.According to Wikipedia :An API is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works, exposing only those parts a programmer will find useful and keeping them consistent even if the internal details later change.Hence what data you can get through API highly depends on which part of the information is open to the public. In most cases, applications and services would offer only limited access to the public free of charge or sometimes at a cost.This is where web scraping shines: whereas an API only offers access to specific data, web scraping allows access to any dataset so long as it is accessible to the public. You can tailor your scraper to collect exactly the data you need, not just what a company decides to share through their API. For instance, while Twitters API might limit you to recent tweets with specific parameters, a scraper could potentially access historical data, user profiles, and engagement metrics that arent available through official channels.The specification to build an API connection varies from app to app. If you are looking for data from only one or a few sources, and luckily the data you need is all granted, you can study the API specification and take advantage of it. Honestly, maintaining an API connection could be easier than maintaining a web scraper.A web scraping tool can become a data console where you gather data from different websites with a series of scrapers and become a data pipeline when you connect the tool to your database. A web scraper can ignore the limit of API and extract what data you can see on the browser. Therefore, web scraping is more customizable, and when you need data from multiple sources, more powerful as an aggregator.The disadvantages of web scrapingWeb scraping is powerful, and you may have heard of some of its limits and wonder if you are able to deal with them. For example, during the scraping, we can get blocked by the target websites. In this section, we will have a closer look at them. Tips: If you want to know more possible obstacles, check article 9 web scraping challenges are discussed. Octoparse has its customizable solutions to different situations. If you are stuck in any one of these issues and wonder if Octoparse can be your alternative solution, feel free to contact us at supportoctoparse.com . Our colleagues are happy to help.Start with a learning curveWeb scraping tasks can be a lot easier with a no-code web scraping tool like Octoparse since a non-coder does not have to learn Python, R, or PHP from scratch and can take advantage of the intuitive UI and the guide panel.However, even a web scraping tool takes time to get familiar with because you have to understand the basic idea of how a web scraper works so that you can command the tool to help you build the scraper.For example, you shall know how the data is weaved into an HTML file with different HTML tags and structures. You may learn the basics of Xpath to locate the data you need. This is also what I learned (and more) throughout my journey with Octoparse.Your IP may be blockedWeb scraping is about frequently visiting a website or a set of web pages, sometimes clicking and sending many requests in a short period of time (so as to capture the required data on the pages). Because of the abnormal frequency, your device or IP may be detected as a suspicious robot that is executing malicious attacks on the service.IP blocking is likely to happen when you scrape websites that are protected with strict anti-scraping techniques, such as LinkedIn and Facebook. The tracking and detection are mainly based on the IP footprint. Therefore, IP rotation or using IP proxies is an important technique for anti-blocking.This is inevitable due to the speed of web scraping, while solutions like IP proxies and Cloud services offer a way out. Learn more about web scraping limitations .Web scraper requires maintenanceThe scraper is built to grab data according to the HTML structure. If the website you are scraping has changed its structure. For example, the data you need is moving from place A to place B, and you then have to amend your scraper to adjust to the change.We have no control over the external website, hence only keeping up with it. As long as you get a hang of a web scraping tool, and become familiar with the anti-scraping tricks, it would be easier for you to react to these changes.How to Start Web Scraping There are a lot of crash courses on platforms like YouTube and Medium to teach people how to start learning web scraping with Python. But to be honest, not everyone is good at coding. If you are a total newbie in programming, you can start with a no-code or low-code method. It can be a perfect choice because you can still get the data you want without writing any line of code.A use case is that a user needs to scrape YouTube data for marketing purposes. But she could not write a line of code. So she worked in Octoparse , a no-code web scraping tool.Octoparse: A No-code Solution for Web ScrapingIf you are looking for a way to get data with web scraping and want to start easy, a no-code tool would be a nice pick even though you are new to it. Compared with writing scripts to build scrapers, using a no-code tool like Octoparse is definitely more time-saving and effortless.When the user we mentioned above started using Octoparse, it only took her about two weeks to get familiar with the software and learn about the basics of HTML and XPath (these can help locate elements on the page more accurately). Then she successfully built a YouTube scraper herself and got the wanted data. If you are interested in this story, you can check the article on how a marketer made use of no-code web scraping at work on Medium.And here are some resources you may need along the way as you get onboard: Octoparse 101: The essential start guides for Octoparse beginners YouTube videos: web scraping cases with Octoparse TOP 10 Free Web Scrapers You Cannot Miss in 2025Whats Driving Web Scraping in the FutureThe future of web scraping is being shaped by several powerful trends:AI-Powered Scraping :AI-based scrapers can achieve accuracy rates of up to 99.5 when handling dynamic, JavaScript-heavy websites ( Marketgrowthreports ), and theyre getting smarter at adapting to layout changes automatically.

Visual data scraping and video content analysis are opening new possibilities for product cataloging, trend analysis, and multimedia marketing strategies.Ethical and Compliant Scraping :As data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA become more stringent, compliance is now non-negotiable. The successful scrapers of tomorrow will be those that respect both legal boundaries and ethical standardsusing transparent data policies, proper anonymization, and responsible collection practices.Conclusion If you are looking for a way to get data with web scraping and want to start easy, a no-code tool would be a nice pick even though you are new to it.

It Depends. Octoparse Is Web Scraping Legal and WhyGenerally, web scraping public information from websites is legal This article gives six tips about how to scrape webpages properly.Generally, scraping public information from websites is legal, whereas scraping private account data will raise privacy concerns. Here are a few popular use cases to show how different industries do web scraping in a well-accepted way.It Depends On How You Use The Scraped DataIf youre doing web crawling for your own purposes, then it is legal as it falls under the fair use doctrine such as market research and academic research. The complications start if you want to use scraped data for others, especially commercial purposes.Quoted from Wikipedia.org, eBay v. Bidders Edge, 100 F.Supp.2d 1058 (N.D. Cal. 2000) , was a leading case applying the trespass to chattels doctrine to online activities. In 2000, eBay, an online auction company, successfully used the trespass to chattels theory to obtain a preliminary injunction preventing Bidders Edge, an auction data aggregator, from using a crawler to gather data from eBays website. The opinion was a leading case applying trespass to chattels to online activities, although its analysis has been criticized in more recent jurisprudence.The Legal Theories and Laws in Different CountriesThe versatility of web scraping allows access to data so easily that it would be natural to worry about potential information abuse or misuse. For people who want to decrease the likelihood of legal controversies in web scraping, it is important to identify the legal risks around web scraping.Here comes the ultimate question: to scrape or not to scrape? Is web scraping illegal or not? What are the potential legal implications of using web scraping? Unfortunately, there is no short answer to these questions. Due to the relative novelty of web scraping in a legal context, the line between legitimate and evil use of this technique is still hard to define in most countries. For a decade or so, web scraping was only guided by a set of related, fundamental legal theories and laws, such as: Copyright Infringement Breach of Contract Violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) Trespass to ChattelsIn most countries, law enforcement specifically for web scraping is not clearly defined yet. However, with the onset of GDPR regulations, more and more people have realized the need to comply with legal standards before proceeding with a scraping project to avoid falling into a tricky legal situation. As international legal circumstances vary widely, this part only discusses the legal risks of web scraping in the United States and Europe.1. The Case of the United States In the US, the law regarding web scraping is still developing and implicates a large number of statutory regimes and areas of common law. There are major types of legal claims that website owners can use to avoid undesired web scraping. For example, web-scraping activity may implicate federal statutes, such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and insider trading laws; state blue sky laws; privacy laws; and common law claims, such as breach of contract, fraud, and trespass to chattels.CFAAThe CFAA proscribes intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access, and thereby obtaining information from any protected computer. Courts have disagreed, however, on what constitutes access without authorization or exceeding authorization.In hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp ., the court claims that a users act of accessing data made available by the owner to the general public does not constitute access without authorization under the CFAA. Yet in Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc ., the court held that a user accesses a computer without authorization when he or she continues to circumvent technological measures employed by the operator to block that users access.Some significant court decisions in 2020 also bear on whether scraping data that one is authorized to access for certain purposes such as browsing as a potential customer or participating as a member of a social media network but not authorized to access for web-scraping purposes, constitutes a breach of the CFAA. We are not going to elaborate on that in this article. In short, although the scope of the CFAAs access provision is unsettled, a significant authority suggests that the scraping of publicly available information, such as from LinkedIn member profiles, does not violate the CFAA. Likewise, it suggests that violation of a websites terms of use alone, without more, may not violate the CFAA.CopyrightDMCAThe operator of a website that is the target of web scraping may bring a claim for copyright infringement against the user of the web-scraping device by proving: its ownership of a valid copyright; the users copying of the original elements of the work in question.At least one federal court has held that a party faces liability under (a)(1)(A) of the DMCA when it uses bots to circumvent security measures that control nonhuman access to copyrighted material on a webpage.It is also worth noting the general copyright principle that, although compilations of facts can be protected by copyright, authors may not copyright their ideas or the facts they narrate. Accordingly, if the data scraped are purely facts without a creative component, then there is no copyright claim.Privacy Statutes Web scraping may also implicate the privacy statutes of states and other jurisdictions. For example, the E.U.s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 grant consumers a variety of rights and protections with respect to their personal information. Web-scraping activity that compiles personally identifiable information could implicate a variety of privacy statutes and potentially subject a web scraper to government and private litigation.Insider TradingUnder certain circumstances, web scraping could also potentially violate federal insider trading law or state blue sky laws. For example, using affirmative misrepresentations to obtain material nonpublic information through web scraping and then trading based on that information could potentially constitute insider trading.However, the law in this area is unsettled, and it remains to be seen how strict an approach regulators and law enforcement may take when deciding what constitutes a breach of duty or deception in the web-scraping context.Breach of contractIn addition to the boundaries imposed by the statutes discussed above, a plaintiff could seek to invoke various common law remedies in an attempt to stem or curtail web scraping. For instance, some website operators have attempted to assert claims for breach of contract against alleged web scrapers. Courts, however, have held that defendants must be on notice of a websites terms of service for the terms to be enforced against them.2. Is Web Scraping Legal in Europe?Today 69 of the population above the age of 16 in the EU have heard about the GDPR and 71 of people heard about their national data protection authority, according to results published in a survey from the EU Fundamental Rights Agency .Though still in its infancy, the GDPR is one of the most comprehensive and impactful data protection laws to date. It has radically changed how businesses scrape the web in Europe. If your scraping project needs you to scrape PIIs, to avoid hefty fines, it is better to make sure youre GDPR-compliant. See our blog on GDPR: GDPR Compliance In Web Scraping , which covers almost everything you need to know about GDPR.mportant regulations include: GDPRrequires lawful basis for processing personal data, even if public Digital Single Market Directivepermits data mining for research and innovation Database Directiveprotects substantial database investments National variationsacross 27 EU member statesUK Post-Brexit: Similar protections under UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, and Computer Misuse Act.The key difference : EU treats publicly available personal data as still requiring consent or legitimate interest justification, unlike the US approach.3. Is Web Scrapnig Legal in Asia?China, India, and Japan are all implementing frameworks that make European compliance look simple.Chinas new reality is harsh but predictable. The January 2025 Network Data Security Management Regulations established mandatory data localization for major operators and enhanced audit requirements. The good news is if you focus on publicly available information and avoid personal data entirely, compliance becomes much simpler. Indias Digital Personal Data Protection Act creates unique opportunities through its narrow territorial scope. Unlike GDPRs complex balancing tests, Indias framework provides a clear exemption for publicly available information made available by data subjects themselves. Smart companies are restructuring operations to leverage this exemption.Japan is taking the most innovation-friendly approach. Proposed 2025 amendments would permit personal data use for AI training without individual consent, while reciprocal adequacy arrangements with the EU and UK create streamlined compliance pathways.Structure data collection across jurisdictions based on each regions comparative regulatory advantages while maintaining global compliance standards.Best Practices for Legal Web Scraping Check robots.txt filesbefore scraping Respect rate limitsto avoid server overload Review terms of servicefor scraping policies Use APIs when availableas the preferred method Avoid personal dataunless compliant with privacy laws Dont republish copyrighted contentwithout permission Implement proper attributionfor data sources Monitor legal developmentsas regulations evolveOn the whole, the law on web scraping is still developing, and only further court decisions and legal pronouncements will thoroughly define its parameters. To avoid being involved in lawsuits, the following is a non-exhaustive list of practical tips for users who have engaged in web scraping.1.Respect and follow the Terms of Service.Always review the websites Terms of Services (ToS) and robot.txt files before consenting to web scraping data collection activity. If possible, get prior permission from the owner of the website.2. Scrape at a reasonable and moderate rate.Be gentle and dont be aggressive. Give the scraped website some breathing space. When youre scraping, you should hit the website within a reasonable time interval and keep the number of requests in control. Avoid adversely impacting a websites physical operation, which could lead to a claim for trespass to chattels or similar claims.3. Monitor and consider any actions a website takes to restrict web scraping.If a website clearly restricts your web scraping activities with various anti-scraping measures, such as the use of CAPTCHAs, rate limits, blocking of IP addresses, etc., you need to be cautious of potential legal risks. Be prepared to stop if asked to do so through a cease-and-desist letter or otherwise.4. Avoid collecting personally identifiable information.Consider whether any data to be scraped belongs to the PII of EU citizens. You can only scrape these data with one of the five reasons below: Consent The consent of the data subject Contract A contract with the data subject Compliance Necessity for compliance with a legal obligation. Vital Interest, Public Interest, or Official Authority In the publics interest. Legitimate Interest Necessity for other legitimate interests5. Consider whether any data to be scraped is protected by copyright.Dont scrape the copyrighted or patented data because you could be involved with copyright infringement.6. Make good use of the scraped data.Dont share the scraped data randomly with others. Use data wisely to generate more insights and help improve your business.When Your Web Scraper Becomes a Legal Liability Do you know web scraper can crash a websites server?Speed is tempting. When youre staring at thousands of product listings, job postings, or search results, the urge to scrape everything as fast as possible is understandable. Some scraping tools even advertise it as a feature: Collect millions of data points in seconds!But heres what those ads dont mention: that speed can land you in court.1 . The real cost of scraping too fast :When a web scraper sends requests faster than a server can handle, the consequences cascade quickly. The servers CPU maxes out. Memory fills up. Response times slow to a crawl. And if youre hitting a smaller website or one thats already under heavy load, your scraper might be the straw that breaks the camels backcausing the entire site to crash.At that point, youre no longer just collecting data. Youre causing real, measurable harm. And under a legal doctrine called trespass to chattelsa principle dating back to English common law that protects property from harmful interferenceyou can be held personally liable for that damage.The landmark case here is eBay v. Bidders Edge (2000), where the court found that even automated queries that dont immediately crash a server can constitute trespass to chattels if they burden the system. More recently, legal scholars Dryer and Stockton (2013) have documented how this principle applies specifically to aggressive web scraping that overloads server resources.2. What trespass to chattels means for you :This isnt just academic legal theory. If your scraping causes a website to go down, the owner can sue you for: Direct damages: Server repair costs, lost revenue during downtime, and the cost of implementing new anti-scraping measures Consequential damages: Loss of customer trust, reputation damage, and missed business opportunities Injunctive relief: A court order permanently banning you from accessing the website Legal fees: In some cases, youll pay the website owners attorney costs tooAnd you dont need to intend harm. The doctrine of trespass to chattels doesnt require malicious intentjust that your actions caused damage to someone elses property.The deceptive appeal of maximum speed scraping :Heres how the problem typically unfolds. You find a scraping tool that promises to collect data at incredible speeds. You configure it to extract 10,000 product pages. You click start. And for a few glorious minutes, data pours in faster than you ever imagined.Then the requests start timing out. The website slows to a crawl. You might see HTTP 503 or 504 errors signs the server is overloaded. If youre scraping a major e-commerce site with enterprise infrastructure, their systems might handle it (though youll likely get IP-banned). But if youre targeting a smaller business, a regional news site, or an industry-specific database? Your scraper might have just brought down their entire online presence.The site owner wont see researcher gathering data. Theyll see what looks like a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack . And theyll respond accordinglywith lawyers. The Facebook v. Power Ventures (2016) case illustrates why complaint scraping matters.Power Ventures continued scraping Facebook after being explicitly told to stop. The court didnt just find against them on the meritsit awarded Facebook substantial damages. Contrast that with companies like OpenAI and Google, which negotiated licensing agreements with Reddit in 2024. When Reddit later sued other scrapers, those licenses demonstrated the proper path.Can I Scrape Public Data for Commercial AI Training Without Permission?On October 22, 2025, Reddit filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against Perplexity AI and three data-scraping companiesSerpAPI, Oxylabs UAB, and AWMProxyalleging industrial-scale, unlawful scraping of Reddit content for commercial AI training. Four months earlier, Reddit had sued Anthropic, maker of Claude AI, on similar grounds. Together, these cases highlight a critical question: when does scraping public data for AI training cross legal boundaries?According to Reddits complaint, defendants accessed nearly two billion Google search results containing Reddit data. When Reddit couldnt be scraped directly due to anti-scraping protections, defendants allegedly scraped Reddit content from Googles search results insteadwhat Reddits chief legal officer Ben Lee called hijacking the armored truck when you cant get into the vault.The alleged methods included rotating IP addresses, fake user agents, and large-scale proxy networks. Reddit even set a trap: they created a test post visible only to Google. Within hours, it appeared in Perplexitys answers, demonstrating the indirect scraping.After Reddit sent Perplexity a cease-and-desist in May 2024, Reddit alleges that Perplexitys citations of Reddit content increased 40-foldnot exactly the response of a company acting in good faith.Moreover, Reddits lawsuits invoke multiple legal theories:Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) prohibits circumventing technological measures controlling access to copyrighted works. Using proxies and fake user agents to bypass anti-scraping protections may violate thisregardless of whether the underlying use would be copyright infringement.Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) addresses unauthorized computer access. While the Ninth Circuits 2022 hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn decision held that scraping public data doesnt automatically violate CFAA, continuing after a cease-and-desist demonstrates lack of authorization.Unfair competition and breach of contract claims focus on commercial harm and Terms of Service violations. If youre using scraped data to build products that compete with the source platform, youre on shaky legal ground.This reveals the open internet tensionPerplexity defends its practices as protecting users rights to freely and fairly access public knowledge. Some commentators, including Techdirt founder Mike Masnick, worry that Reddits position could harm the open internets fundamental model.But Reddit counters: major companies like Google and OpenAI paid for licensing agreements. If those industry leaders recognized that commercial AI training requires permission, why should others get a free pass?The Anthropic lawsuit adds complexity. Reddit claims Anthropic CEO Dario Amodeis own research acknowledged using Reddit data to train Claude since 2021. Anthropics defense strategyarguing the claims should be preempted by federal copyright lawmay shape how platforms can assert control over their data.A pattern is emerged across the industry These Reddit cases are part of a broader wave: The New York Times sued OpenAI, Getty Images sued Stability AI, and music labels sued over song lyrics in training data. The message from content creators is clear: build your AI empire, but dont do it with our data without asking.And You may wonder: what it means for youIf youre considering scraping for AI training, heres what matters: Licensing is becoming standard. Budget for it as a core expense. When industry giants are paying for access, unauthorized use is high-risk. Public doesnt mean freely usable for commercial AI. Visibility on your screen doesnt grant unlimited commercial rights. Technical evasion signals bad faith. Proxies, IP rotation, and ignoring cease-and-desist letters are factors courts weigh heavily against you. This is what sunk Power Ventures v. Facebook (2016) and Craigslist v. 3Taps (2013). Scale matters. A small academic project is different from scraping billions of records for a commercial product. Document good faith. If youre scraping legitimately, show you tried to do it properly: respect robots.txt, implement rate limits, and seek permission when appropriate.The legal landscape around AI training data is evolving rapidly. These cases wont be decided for years, but their outcomes will define the rules. For now, the safest path is clear: when scraping at scale for commercial AI applications, seek licensing agreements. Its cheaper than litigation and increasingly the only viable path forward.Wrap-upWeb scraping itself is not illegal, but people need to be careful with how to use this technique even though there are still a lot of gray areas around law enforcement of web scraping. A negative answer to all the questions now does not necessarily give a clearance to proceed with the scraping project in the future. It is wise to stay up to date on evolving laws in this area. If you are hesitating about whether to scrape a certain website, a safer way to do it is to consult a lawyer for advice.In addition, it is extremely important to make an informed choice of your web scraping tools if you want to lower your legal risks. Consider using popular web scraping tools like Octoparse. It has a large user base and only processes or shares data based on the five legal bases mentioned above.

It can be an extremely hard thing if you want to reuse the data or gather the specific information you need.  As the API used by Craigslist only allows you to post, however, you will be unable to pull read-only data.If you want to extract data from Craigslist but dont know how, this is the article for you. In the following parts, you can learn about why scrape Craigslist, is it legal to scrape Craigslist, and the step-by-step tutorial.Why Scrape Craigslist DataCraigslist gathers an extensive array of information. Without a doubt, it is definitely one of the popular websites to scrape. Why? Here are some of the most typical reasons.1.

No doubt that leads are important, especially qualified ones. This is probably the reason why Craigslist appeals to so many people.3. Gain profits by reselling goodsWith scraped data in a good structure, people can better analyze prices and set new ones for reselling.

Being informed of their strategies in real-time will help businesses gain an edge in competition.Is It Legal to Scrape CraigslistAs one of the most popular websites out there to scrape, Craigslist has proved to be one of the toughest ones.

Craigslist has used various technologies and legal practices to prevent being scraped for commercial purposes. In fact, in April 2017, Craigslist obtained a 60.5 million judgment against 3 Taps Inc, a company that is accused of scraping real estate listings. A few months later, Craigslist reached another 31 million judgment with Instamotor, claiming that Instamotors car listing service was scraped from Craigslist, and they sent unsolicited emails to Craigslist users for promotional purposes.Nevertheless, as explained in the article 10 Myths about Web Scraping , it is illegal if you scrape confidential information for profit, but if you scrape public data discreetly for personal use, you should be fine.How to Scrape Data from CraigslistMethod 1: Scrape Craigslist with PythonIf you are a coder, you can check out this Scrapy tutorial to learn to crawl Craigslists Architecture Engineering jobs in New York and store the data in a CSV file.Method 2: Extract Craigslist data by preset templateBut the problem with the above tutorials is obvious: they are way too complicated for non-coders.

Here Ill make a comparison.Public user feedback on Apifys Indeed Scraper template shows clear limitations in scraping volume and precision. Users report issues such as: Scraper didnt find any jobs even when matching listings exist Output seemingly capped around1,000 results per run Inaccurate keyword matching, returning unrelated job titlesSome time ago, we were even only able to collect 25 pieces of data using this template.These issues suggest the template is not well suited for large-scale or precise job scraping . By contrast, Octoparse delivers both scale and data accuracy . In a single test run, Octoparse successfully extracted 826 job records in one task , with zero duplicates and stable execution, as shown below. This result reflects actual available job listings rather than partial or mismatched outputs.With configurable pagination and extraction rules, Octoparse supports complete, accurate, and scalable Indeed job data collection.Apify charges 5 per 1,000 results , which can become costly for users running high-volume or recurring scraping tasksespecially given the volume and accuracy issues mentioned above.In contrast, Octoparse offers a significantly lower cost at 2 per 1,000 results under comparable scenarios, making it more suitable for teams or individuals who need to collect job data at scale over time.3. Which One Should You Choose? If you only needsmall, occasional datasetsand prefer a ready-made API template, Apify may be sufficient. If you care aboutlower long-term cost, higher control, visual debugging, and scalable scraping,Octoparse is the more cost-effective and stable choicefor Indeed job data collection.Scraping Indeed Job Postings with PythonPython is a versatile programming language that can be used for multiple tasks and if you are good with using the language and creating codes, Python can also be used for scraping Indeed job postings.To extract Indeed data, we would use Beautiful Soup (bs4) which is a Python library for getting the data from HTML and XML files. Since the module is not built-in with Python, the below-given command will help in its installation.Next, for sending the HTTP1.1, a request command is to be givenNext, comes the step for importing the requested modules and requesting the URL to get a response.Next, convert the data into HTML code and then Parse the HTML content using bs4.Finally, the code has to be used for data extraction.Now, you can get the job posting data from Indeed easily with the 2 methods above. One is using Octoparse without coding, and the other is using Python which asks for coding knowledge.

Help Center lessNew Tests and New Items: Opportunities and Issues2005, Computer-Based Testing and the InternetRelated papersAbstractThe paper discusses the impact of technology on society, particularly in terms of testing practices in high-stakes environments. It emphasizes the need for efficient item generation mechanisms and the importance of verifying the claims made by computerized adaptive testing vendors. Furthermore, it highlights the challenges associated with continuous testing, such as security concerns and the necessity for larger item pools and enhanced exposure control.Key takeaways The International Test Commission (ITC) promotes ethical testing standards globally since its formation in 1976. Computer-Based Testing (CBT) enhances measurement efficiency and flexibility, but raises security and validity concerns. Innovative computerized tests can assess complex skills, yet require robust scoring algorithms and frameworks. The shift to online assessments necessitates careful consideration of candidate familiarity with technology to ensure fairness. Continuous testing demands larger item banks and adaptive strategies to mitigate risks of item exposure and maintain test integrity.FAQ'sThe ITC aims to promote ethical test development and use, and enhance international testing practices indicated by their established guidelines and 127 member organizations as of March 2003.Computerized testing improves efficiency and flexibility, enabling real-time scoring and adaptive item selection, which has been shown to enhance measurement quality in high-stakes certifications like CPA exams.Continuous testing increases the risk of item pool exposure, necessitating methods for controlling item access and ensuring security to maintain examination integrity, particularly observed in the USMLE scenario.Innovative item formats, such as simulations and multimedia components, allow for more authentic assessments of skills and knowledge compared to traditional formats, as evidenced in licensing examinations by the AICPA.Future assessments are expected to integrate sophisticated technology and scoring methods, addressing contemporary challenges such as maintaining validity amidst complex performance tasks and adapting to evolving educational demands.Download research papers forfree!Related papersGasselin P., Lardon S., Cerdan C., Loudiyi S.

At the time, Oxford offered a few megabytes of space for personal websites, and you had to write your own HTML, and FTP files to the server yourself. Richard thought there should be a one-click way of creating a homepage, and uploading papers. Having a homepage shouldnt require technical ability. Richard asked a few of his fellow graduate students, and they felt the same way.In the early days, what mattered most of all was growth: growth in users and papers uploaded. In the first few months, we were growing at a linear rate. Some days 37 users would join, the next day 42, the next day 38. We made it to 50,000 users a year later, and someone posted on Facebook Congratulations; heres to 500,000 users. Richard remembers thinking wow, that is a lot. At a linear rate, that is going to take 10x the amount of time it has taken so far.We started to figure out exponential growth, and we got to 500,000 users, and then quickly to 1 million users. Today 266 million users have joined Academia.edu, and around 140,000 people join Academia.edu each day (Figure 1).Academias mission is to accelerate the worlds research. We believe that science is a transformative lever for technological progress.Archimedes' principle, \"Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world,\" encapsulates this vision.The scientific revolution has significantly driven GDP growth over the past two centuries, as depicted in Figure 2.Science has been pivotal in reducing the cost of clean energy (Figure 3) and has drastically decreased the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease over the last 60 years (Figure 4). Moreover, the cost of sequencing a human genome has plummeted from 100 million in 2001 to 500 today (Figure 5).Accelerating scientific progress means faster advancements in critical areas such as global poverty reduction, clean energy, disease cures, and the development of aligned superintelligence.We have made significant strides in the academic community by providing a platform for researchers to share papers and collaborate globally. We support the open access movement by allowing instant distribution of research and enabling peer review alongside distribution. The platform has over 250 million users and hosts over 50 million academic papers across various disciplines.Academics particularly love the speed at which their research gets read on the Academia.edu platform.We have built the foundation of Academia.edu, and have started to accelerate the worlds research.We are still at day one. Most of the work to accelerate the worlds future lies in the future (Figure 6). I find that inspiring. These are Academias milestones after 2026 (Figure 6):2026: Have a portfolio of high impact open access academic journals.2027: Have the worlds best paper recommendation system2028: Academics are commenting and engaging daily on the latest results2029: Host 100 million papers LeadershipAcademias leadership team includes founder and CEO Richard Price, CTO Nate Sullivan, and other key members such as Chief Product Growth Officer Jason Kellerman, Chief People Officer Em Kintner, and Chief Publishing Officer Delia Mihaila.The team brings diverse expertise in academic, technical, financial, and organizational development, driving the companys strategic and operational success.Academia's leadership TeamAcademias team members are mission-oriented, kind, and curious about the world.

This means real-time detection of suspicious behavior, multiple devices, or unauthorized actions without intruding on the candidates privacy.Whether youre an HR leader, recruiter, or educator, Xobins proctoring suite guarantees the security and integrity of every online test.Why Xobins AI Proctoring Stands OutUnlike conventional monitoring tools, Xobins proctoring solution offers a multi-layered security approach. It integrates AI algorithms, real-time analytics, and customizable controls, allowing organizations to create the perfect balance between strict invigilation and candidate comfort.Heres how Xobin helps you conduct cheat-proof assessments with AI-powered precision.Key Xobin AI Proctoring Features that Prevent CheatingQuestion Shuffle and RandomizationEvery test session is unique. Xobin automatically randomizes question order and answer options, making it impossible for candidates to predict or share exact sequences. This eliminates collusion and guarantees fairness across multiple test sessions.CutCopyPaste DisablingTo prevent plagiarism and information sharing, Xobin blocks all cut, copy, and paste operations, including keyboard shortcuts. This ensures that candidates cant copy questions or search for answers externally. Right Click disablingRight-click menus are completely disabled during tests, ensuring candidates cant use browser developer tools, inspect elements or open any unauthorized windows.Keystroke Recording in Coding TestsFor coding assessments , Xobin records every keystroke to identify a candidates unique typing pattern. This allows evaluators to verify code originality and detect any external code import.Webcam RecordingXobins webcam proctoring utilizes the built-in microphone and camera functionalities to capture continuous video or periodic snapshots throughout the test. This ensures monitoring real-time behavior of candidates without interrupting the test experience.Off-Tab Activity TrackingXobins off-tab activity tracking feature monitors test-takers behavior to detect any attempt to navigate away from the assessment window. If a candidate attempts to switch tabs or access other applications during the assessment, the system immediately flags any off-tab activity and they are promptly warned about the violation of exam rules.Persistent disregard for warnings may result in disqualification from the exam.PS: Warnings are given to candidates.Absentee DetectionUsing advanced motion analysis, Xobin detects when a candidate leaves their seat or moves out of frame, alerting proctors immediately. This ensures the candidate remains present and attentive during the assessment.Multi-Device DetectionOur system identifies simultaneous device usage, such as smartphones or secondary monitors. Even partially visible devices are detected and flagged, ensuring no external resources are used during the assessment. This feature ensures the assessment remains device-locked and secure.Multiple Users DetectionThe AI proctoring system identifies if more than one person appears in the camera frame. This feature assists HR teams in verifying that the right candidate is genuinely attempting the assessment without external assistance.Screen Recording Browser Activity MonitoringXobin records the entire screen session, capturing every movement and browser tab opened. All browser tabs, window switches, and navigations are tracked in real time. Any attempt to visit external pages or open new windows is instantly flagged.Eye TrackingUsing advanced eye-tracking technology, Xobin monitors gaze direction to detect if the candidate frequently looks away from the screen, a common indicator of external help. Frequent off-screen gazes trigger real-time alerts for potential misconduct.Audio Recording Real-Time AnalysisThrough microphone access, Xobin captures and analyzes background noise, detecting conversations or other forms of unauthorized help. Every sound event is analyzed in real-time by AI for accurate flagging.Secure Browser (XoLock)Xobin offers a secure browser environment that blocks all external applications, pop-ups, and unauthorized access. It restricts 90 of external app access, creating a closed and distraction-free environment.Real-Time Live ProctoringXobin also offers live human proctoring for added security. Trained proctors oversee small candidate batches, ensuring no suspicious behavior goes unnoticed.Plagiarism DetectionXobin scans codes or subjective answers of candidates to detect plagiarism or duplicate content. Detailed proctoring reports help recruiters identify originality of assessment and candidate integrity.Non-Googleable QuestionsThese are custom-built questions which can not be searched on the web, require critical thinking and personal interpretation to answer the question.AI Trust Score Algorithm At the end of each test, Xobins Trust Score evaluates a candidates overall integrity based on multiple proctoring signals. This helps recruiters instantly identify which candidates took the test honestly and which ones might require review.Why Enterprises Choose Xobin for Secure Online AssessmentsXobins AI proctoring system is trusted by enterprises and fast-scaling startups for its ability to deliver secure, fair, and scalable talent assessments.

AI Trust Score:Generates integrity score based on candidates behavior and activity.What is Online Proctoring?Online proctoring refers to the process of supervising candidates remotely during online assessments to ensure fairness and prevent cheating.Traditionally, human invigilators monitored exams physically. But with Xobins AI-driven proctoring, most of the supervision is automated. This means real-time detection of suspicious behavior, multiple devices, or unauthorized actions without intruding on the candidates privacy.Whether youre an HR leader, recruiter, or educator, Xobins proctoring suite guarantees the security and integrity of every online test.Why Xobins AI Proctoring Stands OutUnlike conventional monitoring tools, Xobins proctoring solution offers a multi-layered security approach. It integrates AI algorithms, real-time analytics, and customizable controls, allowing organizations to create the perfect balance between strict invigilation and candidate comfort.Heres how Xobin helps you conduct cheat-proof assessments with AI-powered precision.Key Xobin AI Proctoring Features that Prevent CheatingQuestion Shuffle and RandomizationEvery test session is unique. Xobin automatically randomizes question order and answer options, making it impossible for candidates to predict or share exact sequences. This eliminates collusion and guarantees fairness across multiple test sessions.CutCopyPaste DisablingTo prevent plagiarism and information sharing, Xobin blocks all cut, copy, and paste operations, including keyboard shortcuts. This ensures that candidates cant copy questions or search for answers externally. Right Click disablingRight-click menus are completely disabled during tests, ensuring candidates cant use browser developer tools, inspect elements or open any unauthorized windows.Keystroke Recording in Coding TestsFor coding assessments , Xobin records every keystroke to identify a candidates unique typing pattern. This allows evaluators to verify code originality and detect any external code import.Webcam RecordingXobins webcam proctoring utilizes the built-in microphone and camera functionalities to capture continuous video or periodic snapshots throughout the test. This ensures monitoring real-time behavior of candidates without interrupting the test experience.Off-Tab Activity TrackingXobins off-tab activity tracking feature monitors test-takers behavior to detect any attempt to navigate away from the assessment window. If a candidate attempts to switch tabs or access other applications during the assessment, the system immediately flags any off-tab activity and they are promptly warned about the violation of exam rules.Persistent disregard for warnings may result in disqualification from the exam.PS: Warnings are given to candidates.Absentee DetectionUsing advanced motion analysis, Xobin detects when a candidate leaves their seat or moves out of frame, alerting proctors immediately. This ensures the candidate remains present and attentive during the assessment.Multi-Device DetectionOur system identifies simultaneous device usage, such as smartphones or secondary monitors. Even partially visible devices are detected and flagged, ensuring no external resources are used during the assessment. This feature ensures the assessment remains device-locked and secure.Multiple Users DetectionThe AI proctoring system identifies if more than one person appears in the camera frame. This feature assists HR teams in verifying that the right candidate is genuinely attempting the assessment without external assistance.Screen Recording Browser Activity MonitoringXobin records the entire screen session, capturing every movement and browser tab opened. All browser tabs, window switches, and navigations are tracked in real time. Any attempt to visit external pages or open new windows is instantly flagged.Eye TrackingUsing advanced eye-tracking technology, Xobin monitors gaze direction to detect if the candidate frequently looks away from the screen, a common indicator of external help. Frequent off-screen gazes trigger real-time alerts for potential misconduct.Audio Recording Real-Time AnalysisThrough microphone access, Xobin captures and analyzes background noise, detecting conversations or other forms of unauthorized help. Every sound event is analyzed in real-time by AI for accurate flagging.Secure Browser (XoLock)Xobin offers a secure browser environment that blocks all external applications, pop-ups, and unauthorized access. It restricts 90 of external app access, creating a closed and distraction-free environment.Real-Time Live ProctoringXobin also offers live human proctoring for added security. Trained proctors oversee small candidate batches, ensuring no suspicious behavior goes unnoticed.Plagiarism DetectionXobin scans codes or subjective answers of candidates to detect plagiarism or duplicate content. Detailed proctoring reports help recruiters identify originality of assessment and candidate integrity.Non-Googleable QuestionsThese are custom-built questions which can not be searched on the web, require critical thinking and personal interpretation to answer the question.AI Trust Score Algorithm At the end of each test, Xobins Trust Score evaluates a candidates overall integrity based on multiple proctoring signals. This helps recruiters instantly identify which candidates took the test honestly and which ones might require review.Why Enterprises Choose Xobin for Secure Online AssessmentsXobins AI proctoring system is trusted by enterprises and fast-scaling startups for its ability to deliver secure, fair, and scalable talent assessments.
